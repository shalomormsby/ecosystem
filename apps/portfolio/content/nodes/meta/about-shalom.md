# About Shalom Ormsby

## Who I Am

I'm a **Product Designer & Creative Technologist** dedicated to creating experiences that are lovable by design.

I believe that **philosophy is only meaningful when embodied**—and this entire ecosystem is proof of that commitment.

## What I Do

I design products and experiences that go beyond usability to touch hearts. My work spans:

- **Product Design** - Leading design for B2B SaaS platforms (SetSail, and others)
- **Design Systems** - Building coherent, human-centered design languages
- **Creative Powerup** - Helping purpose-driven creators bring their visions to life
- **Open Source** - Sharing knowledge and tools that democratize access to great design

## What I Believe

**Love Is the Way.** Everything I create is grounded in a fundamental belief that we can build a more humane, connected, and beautiful world—one experience, one interaction, one moment of genuine care at a time.

## The Design Philosophy

My work is guided by four principles:

1. **Emotionally Resonant** - Touch hearts, not just solve problems
2. **User Control & Freedom** - People should have agency over their experience
3. **Transparent by Design** - Show the process, not just the polish
4. **Generous by Design** - Open source, teachable, accessible to all

## This Cosmograph

This site itself is an embodiment of these principles. It's:
- **Transparent** - You can see the code, the AI collaboration, the messy process
- **Open Source** - Everything is forkable and adaptable
- **Human-Centered** - You control how you navigate and what you explore
- **Genuine** - This is all of me, not just the highlight reel
