# Shalom's Cosmograph

*The Personal and Professional Digital Ecosystem of Shalom Ormsby, Rendered as a Knowledge Graph that Visitors Can Navigate with AI Assistance*

This is the PRD itself—the document that defined this entire project.

## Core Vision

Our digital lives are fragmented. We create on LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, Substack, and countless other platforms—but these platforms own the connections between our creations. They own the graph.

Shalom's Cosmograph is an act of reclamation. It's personal infrastructure that interconnects all the fragmented expressions into a navigable, coherent whole.

## Why This Exists

This is not a vanity site. It is:
- **A design portfolio** that embodies "Transparent by Design"
- **A personal reclamation project** demonstrating DIY digital sovereignty
- **An open source reference implementation** that others can learn from and adapt
- **A teaching tool** showing what Creative Powerup enables
- **A philosophical statement** that your digital life belongs to you

## The Metaphor

- **You** = Captain (in control)
- **Tri** = Copilot (guides, suggests, assists)
- **The Cosmograph** = Dynamic Map (shows structure)
- **Each Node** = The Terrain (actual content)

The graph doesn't impose structure—it exposes structure that was always there.
