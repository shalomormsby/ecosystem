**Priority:** P3 - Feature Completeness
**Actual Time:** ~2 hours

### Implementation Summary

**Problem Solved:** MCP server registry previously contained only 48 components (54% coverage), limiting AI-powered component discoverability in Claude Desktop and Cursor.

**Solution:** Added 44 missing components to achieve 100% coverage with 92 total components.

### What Was Done

1. **Added 44 New Components to MCP Registry:**
   - **Typography & Display (5):** heading, text, code, collapsible-code-block, description-list
   - **Layout (9):** grid, container, stack, sidebar, header, footer, customizer-panel, page-layout, page-template

   - **Specialty - Cursor (2):** splash-cursor, target-cursor
   - **Specialty - Motion (1):** animated-beam
   - **Specialty - Blocks (2):** hero, open-graph-card

2. **Added 4 New Specialty Categories:**
   - `backgrounds` - Animated background effects (3 components)
   - `cursor` - Custom cursor effects (2 components)
   - `motion` - Animation components (1 component)
   - `blocks` - Composed page sections (2 components)

3. **Updated Category Counts:**
   - Core categories updated with accurate counts
   - Total: 92 components across 11 categories (7 core + 4 specialty)

4. **Updated Tool Definitions:**
   - `list_components` tool now includes specialty categories in enum

### Files Modified

- `/packages/mcp/src/registry.ts` - Added 44 components, updated category counts, added specialty categories
- `/packages/mcp/src/index.ts` - Updated list_components tool to include specialty categories

### Verification

- ✅ MCP server builds successfully: `pnpm build --filter @thesage/mcp`
- ✅ Component count verified: **92 components**
- ✅ All category counts accurate
- ✅ Specialty categories added and documented

### Final Component Count Breakdown

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Actions | 5 |
| Forms | 18 |
| Navigation | 10 |
| Overlays | 11 |
| Feedback | 7 |
| Data Display | 16 |
| Layout | 17 |
| Backgrounds | 3 |
| Cursor | 2 |
| Motion | 1 |
| Blocks | 2 |
| **Total** | **92** |

**Note:** Final count is 92 components (exceeding the original target of 89) due to accurate component enumeration and inclusion of all specialty components.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL

**⚠️ ESSENTIAL RULE FOR ALL LLMs:**

After completing ANY major task or issue, you MUST update documentation in this order:

### 1. User-Facing Documentation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Update these pages IMMEDIATELY after code changes:

**Getting Started Pages:**
- Location: `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`
- URL: https://thesage.dev/docs#overview
- Contains: Installation, Quick Start, Basic Usage, ThemeProvider setup

**MCP Server Pages:**
- Location: `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/`
- URL: https://thesage.dev/docs#mcp-server
- Contains: Installation, Configuration, Tools, Usage, Troubleshooting

### 2. Project Documentation (.md files)
Update these files after user-facing docs:

- **CHANGELOG.md** (root) - Log all significant changes with timestamp
- **README.md** (packages/ui and packages/sds-mcp-server) - Keep package docs in sync
- **AUDIT docs** (this file and AUDIT-PROGRESS.md) - Track completion status

### 3. Verification Steps
After updating docs:

1. ✅ Check that code examples match actual API
2. ✅ Verify all import statements use correct package names
3. ✅ Test that installation commands work
4. ✅ Ensure version numbers are accurate
5. ✅ Confirm all links point to correct locations

### 4. What Counts as "Major Task"

Update docs when you:
- ✅ Complete an audit issue
- ✅ Publish packages to npm
- ✅ Change package names or versions
- ✅ Add/remove components
- ✅ Update APIs or props
- ✅ Fix critical bugs
- ❌ Make minor typo fixes (can batch these)
- ❌ Refactor internal code without API changes

**WHY THIS MATTERS:** User-facing documentation must NEVER drift out of sync with code. Documentation updates are not optional "follow-up work" - they are part of completing the task.

---

### 5. Maintaining Overview and Components Pages

**When to Update Overview Page ("What's Included" Section):**

The Overview page (`apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`) contains a high-level "What's Included" section showing ALL Sage UI offerings. Update this section when:

- ✅ Adding a new offering category (e.g., new Charts package, Templates section)
- ✅ Significantly expanding an existing category (e.g., adding 10+ new components)
- ✅ Changing the scope of what Sage UI provides

**Current Offerings (as of 2026-01-26):**
1. Component Library (89 components in 7 categories)
2. Themes (3 themes: Studio, Sage, Volt)
3. Motion System (User-controlled 0-10 scale)
4. Blocks (Composed page sections)
5. Hooks & Utilities (React hooks for theme/motion control)
6. MCP Server (AI-powered component discovery)

**How to Add a New Offering:**
1. Add a new card to the offerings grid in OverviewSection.tsx
2. Follow the existing pattern: icon, badge, heading, description, CTA link
3. Link to the appropriate section (e.g., `href="#charts"`)
4. Update this documentation to list the new offering

---

**When to Update Components Dashboard:**

The Components Dashboard (`apps/web/app/components/studio/ComponentsDashboard.tsx`) automatically pulls from `COMPONENT_REGISTRY` in `@thesage/ui`. It does NOT need manual updates when adding components.

**Automatic Updates:**
- ✅ Component counts update automatically from `COMPONENT_COUNTS.total`
- ✅ Category lists update automatically from `COMPONENT_REGISTRY.coreCategories`
- ✅ Component names in expanded sections pull from `categoryData.examples`

**When Manual Updates ARE Needed:**
- ❌ Adding a new functional category (e.g., "media" for audio/video components)
  - Must add icon to `CATEGORY_ICONS` object
  - Must update `component-registry.ts` in `@thesage/ui`
  - Must add to navigation tree in `apps/web/app/lib/navigation-tree.tsx`
  - Must add to ComponentsSection category list

**Process for Adding a New Component:**
1. Follow the complete workflow in `.agent/workflows/register-new-component.md`
2. Update `packages/ui/src/component-registry.ts`:
   - Add component name to appropriate category's `examples` array
   - Increment category `count`
   - Increment `totalCount`
3. Build `@thesage/ui`: `pnpm build --filter @thesage/ui`
4. Dashboard updates automatically on next deploy

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Component appears in Components Dashboard when category is expanded
- [ ] Component count badge shows correct number
- [ ] Total count at top of dashboard is accurate
- [ ] Category overview page shows the new component
- [ ] Individual component page exists and is navigable

---

**When to Update Category Overview Pages:**

Category overview pages are rendered by `CategoryOverview` component, which pulls from `COMPONENT_REGISTRY`. They update automatically when you update the registry.

**No manual updates needed** unless:
- ❌ Changing category metadata (icon, description)
  - Update `CATEGORY_METADATA` in `CategoryOverview.tsx`
- ❌ Changing "When to Use" guidance text
  - Update `getCategoryUsageGuidance()` function in `CategoryOverview.tsx`

---

### ✅ Phase 0.2: Fix Component Count Discrepancy - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P0 - CREDIBILITY UNDERMINING
**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Status:** 🟢 **RESOLVED** (January 26, 2026)

**The Problem:**
Documentation claims "48 components across 7 categories" everywhere.

**Actual Reality:**
- **Standard 7 Categories:** 82 components exported
- **Additional Categories:** 10+ specialty components (backgrounds, cursor, motion, blocks)
- **Total Exported:** 90+ components from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`
- **MCP Registry:** Only 36 components listed

**Solution Implemented:**

**1. Created Component Registry as Source of Truth**
- Created `packages/ui/src/component-registry.ts` with complete metadata
- Documents all 89 components with breakdown by category
- Provides marketing copy and documentation templates
- Exported from main `@thesage/ui` package

**2. Accurate Component Count: 89 Total**
- **Core 7 Categories (84 components):**
  - Actions: 5
  - Forms: 18
  - Navigation: 10
  - Overlays: 11
  - Feedback: 7
  - Data Display: 16
  - Layout: 17
- **Specialty (5 components):**
  - Backgrounds: 2
  - Cursor: 2
  - Blocks: 1

**3. Updated All Documentation References**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/OverviewTab.tsx` → "89 components"
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/UsageTab.tsx` → "89 components"
- `packages/sds-mcp-server/README.md` → 3 references updated
- `packages/sds-mcp-server/src/registry.ts` → Header comment updated

**Decision Made:** Count ALL exports as official components (industry standard approach used by Material UI, Radix, Chakra). No artificial "specialty" tier.

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/ui/src/component-registry.ts` (created)
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts` (export registry)
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/OverviewTab.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/UsageTab.tsx`
- `packages/sds-mcp-server/src/registry.ts`
- `packages/sds-mcp-server/README.md`

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] All component counts accurate and consistent (89 everywhere)
- [x] Category counts add up correctly (84 + 5 = 89)
- [x] Component registry serves as single source of truth
- [ ] MCP registry completeness (deferred to Phase 0.12 in Phase 3)

---

### ✅ Phase 0.3: Add Prerequisites & Peer Dependencies - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P0 - PREVENTS SUCCESSFUL SETUP
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Status:** 🟢 **RESOLVED** (January 26, 2026)

**The Problem:**
Getting Started jumps directly to `npm install @shalomormsby/ui` without mentioning:
- System requirements (Node.js version, pnpm version)
- Peer dependencies (`react`, `framer-motion` - REQUIRED but undocumented)
- Tailwind CSS requirement and configuration
- TypeScript version support

**Solution Implemented:**

**1. Added Prerequisites Card**
- Inserted before installation steps in `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`
- Includes system requirements (Node.js 18+, React 18+, Tailwind 3+)
- Lists compatible frameworks (Next.js, Vite, Remix, CRA)
- Documents TypeScript support (optional, 5.0+)

**2. Updated Step 1: Install Dependencies**
- Changed from "Install the package" to "Install dependencies"
- Now explicitly includes peer dependencies: `pnpm add react framer-motion @thesage/ui`
- Explains that React and Framer Motion are required

**3. Added Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS**
- Complete `tailwind.config.ts` example showing content paths
- Shows how to add `@thesage/ui` to Tailwind content array
- Notes that themes use CSS variables (no additional Tailwind config needed)

**4. Renumbered Remaining Steps**
- Step 3: Import and use components (was Step 2)
- Step 4: Wrap with ThemeProvider (was Step 3)
- Step 5: Use Hooks (was Step 4)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`

**Impact:**
- Zero-context users can now successfully set up Sage UI from scratch
- Installation is complete (packages + peer dependencies + configuration)
- No missing prerequisite surprises

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Prerequisites section exists before installation
- [x] All system requirements documented
- [x] Peer dependencies explicitly listed
- [x] Tailwind configuration instructions provided
- [x] Supported frameworks mentioned

## 📋 PHASE 1: PRE-EXTERNAL REVIEW (BEFORE SHOWING TO TEG)

**Goal:** Ensure technical accuracy and completeness
**Timeline:** 1-2 days | **Status:** 🟡 Ready to Start (Phase 0 Complete)

### ✅ Phase 1.4: Add Component Overview Dashboard - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1 - ESSENTIAL SYSTEM STATUS FEEDBACK
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Status:** 🟢 **COMPLETE** - Implemented 2026-01-26

**The Problem:**
Sage Studio documentation doesn't surface the component registry data anywhere. Users can't see:
- Total component count at a glance
- Breakdown by category
- Quick navigation to each category
- System status feedback (key usability heuristic: "Visibility of system status")

**Solution:**
Create a "Component Overview" dashboard section in OverviewSection.tsx that imports and displays component registry metadata.

**Implementation Details:**

**1. Location**
- File: `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`
- Position: After "Who Is This For?" section (around line 180)
- Before: "Get Started in 5 Minutes" section

**2. Import Component Registry**
```typescript
import { COMPONENT_COUNTS, COMPONENT_REGISTRY, MARKETING_COPY } from '@thesage/ui';
```

**3. Display Structure**
```tsx
{/* COMPONENT OVERVIEW DASHBOARD */}
<section>
  <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-[var(--color-text-primary)] text-center">
    What's Included
  </h2>

  {/* Total Count Hero */}
  <div className="text-center mb-8">
    <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-[var(--color-primary)] mb-2">
      {COMPONENT_COUNTS.total}
    </div>
    <p className="text-lg text-[var(--color-text-secondary)]">
      {MARKETING_COPY.medium}
    </p>
  </div>

  {/* Category Breakdown Grid */}
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
    {Object.entries(COMPONENT_REGISTRY.coreCategories).map(([key, category]) => (
      <Card key={key} className="p-4 hover:border-[var(--color-primary)] transition-colors">
        <a href={`#${key}`} className="block">
          <div className="text-3xl font-bold text-[var(--color-primary)] mb-1">
            {category.count}
          </div>
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-[var(--color-text-primary)] mb-2">
            {category.label}
          </h3>
          <p className="text-xs text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] mb-2">
            {category.description}
          </p>
          <p className="text-xs text-[var(--color-text-muted)]">
            {category.examples.slice(0, 2).join(', ')}...
          </p>
        </a>
      </Card>
    ))}
  </div>

  {/* Specialty Components (Optional) */}
  <div className="mt-6">
    <p className="text-sm text-[var(--color-text-muted)] text-center">
      Plus {COMPONENT_COUNTS.specialty} specialty components for backgrounds, cursor effects, and blocks
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**4. Design Specifications**
- Use existing Card component from `@thesage/ui`
- Match Sage Studio's color scheme (CSS variables)
- Cards should be clickable links to category sections (use hash navigation: `#actions`, `#forms`, etc.)
- Hover state: Border changes to primary color
- Responsive grid: 2 cols mobile, 3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop
- Total count should be visually prominent (6xl font, primary color)

**5. Category Data Structure**
From `component-registry.ts`:
- **Actions** (5): Triggers behavior
- **Forms** (18): Collects data
- **Navigation** (10): Moves through content
- **Overlays** (11): Contextual content
- **Feedback** (7): System state
- **Data Display** (16): Information
- **Layout** (17): Organization

**6. Integration Points**
- Ensure hash links match existing section IDs in Sage Studio
- Category sections already exist: `#actions`, `#forms`, `#navigation`, etc.
- Verify smooth scroll behavior works
- Test on mobile, tablet, desktop

**Files to Update:**

### ✅ Phase 1.4.1: Fix Blank Component Category Pages - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P0 - BLOCKING (Must fix before any other Phase 1 work)
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Status:** 🟢 **RESOLVED** (January 26, 2026)

**The Problem:**
The Component Overview Dashboard links to component category sections (#actions, #forms, #navigation, etc.), but these pages are BLANK. Users clicking on category cards get no content, breaking the entire navigation flow.

**Root Cause:**
- Dashboard was added to Overview page with hash links
- Assumed category section pages existed with content
- They don't - users get empty pages

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Populate Category Section Pages (RECOMMENDED)**
- Create actual content for each category section (#actions, #forms, etc.)
- Each page should display:
  - Category name and description
  - Full list of components in that category
  - Link to each component's individual page
  - Usage examples for the category

**Option B: Change Navigation Strategy**
- Instead of hash links to category pages, link directly to individual component pages
- Create a "Components" page with expandable sections
- Each category is a collapsible section showing its components

**Recommended Approach:** Option A
- More scalable as component library grows
- Better SEO and deep linking
- Clearer information architecture

**Implementation Summary (2026-01-26):**

**Completed Actions:**
- [x] Created `CategoryOverview` component as content template for category pages
- [x] Component displays: category name, icon, description, component count, full component list
- [x] All 7 category pages now populated (actions, forms, navigation, overlays, feedback, data-display, layout)
- [x] Category pages pull data from COMPONENT_REGISTRY for accuracy
- [x] Breadcrumbs already exist via ComponentsSection
- [x] All hash links from dashboard tested via build
- [x] Responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop) verified

**Files Created:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/ComponentsSection/CategoryOverview.tsx` (new component)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/ComponentsSection/index.tsx` - Added CategoryOverview import and conditional rendering

**Technical Implementation:**
- ComponentsSection now conditionally renders:
  - `CategoryOverview` when no specific component selected (category landing page)
  - `EnhancedComponentPlayground` when specific component selected
- CategoryOverview features:
  - Category metadata (icon, label, description)
  - Component count badge from COMPONENT_REGISTRY
  - Grid of clickable component cards
  - "When to Use" guidance section
  - Arrow icons indicating navigation
- All components in each category displayed with click-to-navigate behavior

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Clicking any category card navigates to populated page
- [x] All 7 category pages have complete content
- [x] No blank pages anywhere in navigation flow
- [x] Breadcrumbs show current location (existing functionality)
- [x] Back navigation works intuitively (hash-based routing)
- [x] Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors

---

### ✅ Phase 1.4.2: Move Components Dashboard to Dedicated Page - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1 - HIGH (Fix after 1.4.1)
**Effort:** 3-4 hours (combined with 1.4.3)
**Status:** 🟢 **RESOLVED** (January 26, 2026)

**The Problem:**
Component Overview Dashboard is currently on the main Overview page, implying Sage UI only offers components. This is inaccurate and limits perceived scope.

**Actual Sage UI Offerings:**
1. **Components** (89) - UI building blocks
2. **Blocks** - Composed page sections (Hero, OpenGraphCard, etc.)
3. **Themes** (3) - Studio, Sage, Volt with light/dark modes
4. **Motion System** - User-controlled 0-10 scale with prefers-reduced-motion support
5. **Charts** - Data visualization components (via @thesage/charts)
6. **Hooks** - useTheme, useMotionPreference, useForm, etc.
7. **MCP Server** - AI-native component discovery and code generation

**Solution:**

**Part A: Redesign "What's Included" on Overview (High-Level)**
Replace current Component Dashboard with higher-level overview showing ALL offerings:

```tsx
<section id="whats-included">
  <Heading level={2}>What's Included</Heading>

  <Grid cols={2} mdCols={3} gap={4}>
    {/* Components Card */}
    <Card>
      <Badge>89 Components</Badge>

    </Card>

    {/* Blocks Card */}
    <Card>
      <Badge>Blocks</Badge>
      <Heading level={3}>Composed Blocks</Heading>
      <Text>Hero, OpenGraph, feature sections...</Text>
      <Link href="/blocks">View Blocks →</Link>
    </Card>

    {/* Themes Card */}
    <Card>
      <Badge>3 Themes</Badge>
      <Heading level={3}>Themes</Heading>
      <Text>Studio, Sage, Volt with light/dark...</Text>
      <Link href="#themes">Explore Themes →</Link>
    </Card>

    {/* Motion Card */}
    <Card>
      <Badge>Motion System</Badge>
      <Heading level={3}>Motion</Heading>
      <Text>User-controlled animations, 0-10 scale...</Text>
      <Link href="#motion">Learn About Motion →</Link>
    </Card>

    {/* Charts Card */}
    <Card>
      <Badge>Charts</Badge>
      <Heading level={3}>Data Visualization</Heading>
      <Text>@thesage/charts package...</Text>
      <Link href="/charts">View Charts →</Link>
    </Card>

    {/* Hooks Card */}
    <Card>
      <Badge>Hooks</Badge>
      <Heading level={3}>React Hooks</Heading>
      <Text>useTheme, useMotionPreference...</Text>
      <Link href="/hooks">View Hooks →</Link>
    </Card>

    {/* MCP Server Card */}
    <Card>
      <Badge>AI-Native</Badge>
      <Heading level={3}>MCP Server</Heading>
      <Text>AI-powered component discovery...</Text>
      <Link href="#mcp-server">Setup MCP →</Link>
    </Card>
  </Grid>
</section>
```

**Part B: Create New "Components" Section Page**
- New dedicated page for Components Dashboard
- URL: `/components` or hash `#components`
- Move existing Component Overview Dashboard here
- This becomes the landing page for component exploration

**Implementation Summary (2026-01-26):**

### ✅ Phase 1.5: Document ThemeProvider Props - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1 - INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE
**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Status:** 🟢 **COMPLETE** - Implemented 2026-01-26

**The Problem:**
Code example showed `<ThemeProvider defaultTheme="studio" defaultMode="light">` but those props didn't exist in the actual implementation. Documentation needed to accurately reflect the actual API.

**Solution Implemented:**

**1. Corrected ThemeProvider Example**
- Removed non-existent `defaultTheme` and `defaultMode` props from example
- Updated to show accurate minimal usage: `<ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>`

**2. Added Comprehensive Props Table**
- Single prop: `children` (ReactNode, required)
- Clear, accessible table format

**3. Added "Default Theme & Mode" Section**
- Documents actual defaults: `theme: "volt"`, `mode: "dark"`
- Explains localStorage persistence

**4. Added "Programmatic Control" Section**
- Shows how to use `useTheme()` hook to set initial theme/mode
- Provides complete code example with `useEffect` pattern
- Collapsible code block for better UX

**5. Added "Available Options" Section**
- Lists all 3 themes: studio, sage, volt
- Lists 2 modes: light, dark
- Documents storage key: `"ecosystem-theme"`

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines 1141-1201)

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Props table added with accurate information

---

### ✅ Phase 1.6: Explain Motion System Fully - COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1 - CRITICAL ACCESSIBILITY FEATURE
**Effort:** 2 hours
**Status:** 🟢 **COMPLETE** - Implemented 2026-01-27

**The Problem:**
Example showed `useMotionPreference()` hook but didn't explain the motion system comprehensively. Users needed to understand:
- What the 0-10 scale means
- How to set motion preferences
- How it respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Where the Customizer is and how to use it

**Solution Implemented:**

**1. Added "Understanding the Motion System" Section**
- Clear explanation of the 0-10 motion scale
- Emphasis on user control and accessibility

**2. Added Motion Scale Table**
- 5 scale ranges with behavior and use cases:
  - **0**: No animations (instant state changes) - Vestibular disorders
  - **1-3**: Subtle animations (~100-200ms) - Minimal interfaces
  - **5**: Balanced animations (default) - General use
  - **7-9**: Expressive animations - Engaging interfaces
  - **10**: Maximum animation - Highly interactive
- Clean, accessible table format

**3. Added "Automatic Accessibility" Callout**
- Green-tinted info box with checkmark icon
- Key points:
  - Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` automatically
  - `shouldAnimate` returns `false` when scale is 0 OR system preference is reduce
  - Motion scale 0 must work perfectly (no broken layouts)
  - No additional code needed

**4. Added "How Users Set Motion Preferences" Section**
- Three methods documented:

  **Method 1: The Customizer Component (Recommended)**
  - Code example showing `<CustomizerPanel />` usage
  - Described as floating panel with motion slider
  - Collapsible code block

  **Method 2: Programmatically via Hook**
  - Code example showing custom range input
  - Shows `setMotionPreference()` usage
  - Collapsible code block

  **Method 3: System Preference (Automatic)**
  - Explains OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion` support
  - Notes that it overrides scale value

**5. Added Persistence Note**
- Documents localStorage persistence
- Sync across sessions

**Technical Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines 1284-1447)
  - Added ~163 lines of comprehensive documentation
  - Motion scale table with 5 rows
  - Accessibility callout with 4 key points
  - 3 methods for setting preferences with code examples
  - 2 collapsible code blocks for detailed examples

**Documentation Structure:**
```
Step 5: Control themes and motion
├─ Code example (useMotionPreference hook)
└─ Understanding the Motion System
    ├─ Motion Scale Table (0, 1-3, 5, 7-9, 10)
    ├─ Automatic Accessibility (green callout box)
    └─ How Users Set Motion Preferences
        ├─ 1. The Customizer Component (code example)
        ├─ 2. Programmatically via Hook (code example)
        ├─ 3. System Preference (explanation)
        └─ Persistence Note
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Motion scale explained with concrete examples
- [x] 0-10 scale table with behavior and use cases
- [x] Automatic accessibility clearly documented
- [x] Three methods for setting preferences explained
- [x] Code examples provided for Customizer and programmatic control
- [x] localStorage persistence documented
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` integration explained
- [x] Build succeeds with no errors

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users understand the full motion system architecture
- ✅ Clear guidance on accessibility features
- ✅ Multiple pathways to implement motion controls
- ✅ Emphasizes that motion scale 0 must work perfectly
- ✅ Phase 1 progress: 75% complete (3/4 issues resolved)

## 📌 CRITICAL DECISIONS

### ✅ Decision #1: Package Distribution - RESOLVED

**Decision:** Publish to npm as `@thesage`
**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Rationale:** Standard, professional branding for the design system.

**Implementation:**
- Created `@thesage` npm organization
- Published `@thesage/ui`
- Published `@thesage/mcp`
- Updated all documentation

---

### ✅ Decision #2: Component Count Strategy - RESOLVED

**Question:** What counts as "official" component count?

**Options:**
- **A:** 82 components (7 standard categories only)
- **B:** 90+ components (all exports)
- **C:** "82 core + 10 specialty" (clear distinction) ← **RECOMMENDED**

**Blocks:** Phase 0.2

**Impact:** Affects all documentation, MCP registry, marketing

**Recommendation:** Option C provides clarity - "82 core components across 7 categories, plus 10 specialty components (backgrounds, motion effects, cursor interactions)"

---

### ✅ Decision #3: MCP Coverage Strategy - RESOLVED

**Question:** Should MCP registry include ALL 90+ components or curated subset?

**Decision:**
- **A:** All exported components  ← **RECOMMENDED**


**Blocks:** Phase 0.12 (Phase 3)

**Impact:** AI discoverability via Claude Desktop/Cursor

**Recommendation:** Option A - MCP's value is complete discoverability. 50+ missing components hurts user experience.
