## 🚀 Strategic Rebrand: Sage UI -> Sage UI
**Date Added:** 2026-01-20
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Planning

**Objective:** Shift identity from a "Design System" (governance/enterprise constrains) to "Sage UI" (Solopreneur/Velocity Ecosystem). Move from `@sds/*` to `@sage-ui/*` (or `@thesage/*`) namespace.

### Phase 1: Identity & Documentation (Immediate)
- [x] **Documentation Rebrand**:
    - Rename "Sage Studio" -> "Sage Studio" or "Sage UI Studio".
    - Update homepage copy: "The Solopreneur's Development Stack" / "AI-Native Components".
    - Update metadata/titles across the documentation site.
    - [x] Global Find & Replace: `Sage Design System` -> `Sage UI`, `@sds/*` -> `@thesage/*`.
- [x] **Feature Parity Strategy**:
    - [x] Adopt "Mantine-style" utility hook library (`@thesage/hooks`).
    - [x] Adopt "Shadcn-style" chart library (`@thesage/charts`).

### Phase 2: Package Migration (Careful Execution)
*Goal: Rename packages to align with new brand. Proposed Naming: `@thesage/*` or `@sage-ui/*`.*

- [x] **Package Renaming**:
    - `@thesage/ui` -> `@thesage/ui` (The Primitives)
    - `@thesage/tokens` -> `@thesage/tokens`
    - `@thesage/mcp` -> `@thesage/mcp`
- [x] **New Packages**:
    - [x] `@thesage/hooks` (New utility belt)
    - [x] `@thesage/charts` (Recharts wrapper)
    - [ ] `@thesage/templates` (Future Tier 3)
- [x] **Refactor Consumers**:
    - Update imports in `apps/web`
    - Update imports in `apps/portfolio`
    - Update imports in `apps/ecosystem-creative-powerup`
- [x] **Infrastructure**:
    - Update `tsconfig.json` paths.
    - Update `turbo.json` pipeline configuration.

### Phase 3: Public Presence
- [ ] **Domain**: Secure `sage-ui.dev` or `sage-ui.com`.
- [ ] **CLI**: Create `npx sage-ui init` (instead of manual copy-paste).

**Date Added:** 2026-01-16
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** Medium (3-5 days)
**Impact:** High

### Current State
The Motion Intensity slider in the Customizer **partially works** - it updates the store but doesn't affect most animations in the app.

**What's Working:**
- Slider updates the customizer store correctly
- Infrastructure exists (`useMotionPreference` hook is well-designed)
- One component uses it (`VariableWeightText` properly scales animations)

**The Problem:**
Out of **43 files using framer-motion**, only **1 component** respects the motion intensity setting. All other animated components ignore it.

### Original Intent
The motion intensity slider was designed to:
- **Scale animation speed**: Higher intensity = faster/more energetic animations
- **Disable animations**: Setting to 0 completely stops motion
- **Respect accessibility**: Automatically syncs with system `prefers-reduced-motion` preference
- **Provide granular control**: 11 levels (0-10) for fine-tuning motion comfort

The `useMotionPreference` hook provides:
- `shouldAnimate` - Boolean to conditionally render animations
- `scale` - Number (0-10) to scale duration/intensity
- `prefersReducedMotion` - System preference awareness

### Implementation Plan

**What needs to be done:**
1. Audit all components using `motion.` from framer-motion
2. Add `useMotionPreference` hook to each animated component
3. Wrap animations in `shouldAnimate` conditionals
4. Scale duration using: `duration * (5 / scale)` (where 5 is normal)
5. Provide static fallbacks when `shouldAnimate === false`

**Example transformation:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (ignores motion preference)
<motion.div
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
>

// AFTER (respects motion preference)
const { shouldAnimate, scale } = useMotionPreference();

{shouldAnimate ? (
  <motion.div
    animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 * (scale > 0 ? 5 / scale : 0) }}
  >
) : (
  <div style={{ opacity: 1 }}>
)}
```

**Complexity factors:**
- ✅ Hook already exists and is well-designed
- ✅ Pattern established in `VariableWeightText` to follow
- ⚠️ 43 files to update (but most have simple animations)
- ⚠️ Need to test each component's static fallback
- ⚠️ Some complex animations may need custom scaling logic

### Impact
**User Experience Benefits:**
- ✨ **Accessibility compliance** - Critical for users with vestibular disorders
- ✨ **User preference** - Some users simply prefer less motion
- ✨ **Performance** - Users on slower devices can reduce motion overhead
- ✨ **Brand polish** - Shows attention to detail and inclusive design

**Current Consequences:**
- ❌ Slider appears broken (misleading UX)
- ❌ Users with motion sensitivity have no recourse except OS-level settings
- ❌ Violates the principle of user control established by having the slider

### Additional UI Fix Needed
**Slider Background Contrast**: The slider background needs increased contrast, especially in the Volt theme. Currently difficult to see the track/rail.

## Motion Section Evolution
**Date Added:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** In Progress

High-impact tasks to evolve the Sage UI Motion section and make it as useful as possible.

- [ ] **Fill the "Placeholders"**
    - [x] **DurationPage & EasingPage**: Critical foundation primitives. Users need to feel the difference. (Impact: High)
    - [x] **TypewriterPage**: A classic effect. (Impact: Medium)
    - [x] **MagneticPage**: Great for micro-interactions. (Impact: High)
- [ ] **Standardize "Motion Primitives"**
    - Create a `Motion` namespace in `@thesage/ui` (e.g., `<Motion.Fade in>`). Reduces boilerplate. (Impact: High)
- [x] **"Playground" for Motion Tokens**
    - Build a page where users can tweak variables and see real-time effects on dummy UI. (Impact: High) - *Implemented as the new "Primitives" page*
- [ ] **Accessibility First (Reduced Motion)**
    - Audit all motion components. If `prefers-reduced-motion` is true, automatically simplify or disable. (Impact: Critical)
- [ ] **Add "Page Transitions"**
    - Create a standard `<PageTransition>` component for seamless navigation. (Impact: High)
- [ ] **Interactive "Scroll" Components**
    - Add `ScrollReveal` or `Parallax` components. (Impact: High)

## 🏠 Create Sage UI Home and Landing Page
**Date Added:** 2026-01-21
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Planned
**Impact:** Very High (First Impression)

### Objective
Create a landing page that instantly communicates the purpose, structure, and value of Sage UI to both technical users and executive stakeholders (CDOs, design leaders).

### Core Message: "Sage UI - A Systematic Design Language"

**The Four-Layer Hierarchy:**

**1. Design Tokens (Foundation Layer)**
The atomic values that define your brand's visual language—colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and motion. Tokens ensure consistency across all implementations and enable dynamic theming.

*Value*: Single source of truth for design decisions, enabling brand consistency and theme flexibility.

**2. Components (Element Layer)**
Primitive, reusable UI elements—buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs—that implement design tokens and handle core interactions. Each component follows accessibility standards (WCAG AA/AAA) and responds to theme customization.

*Value*: Accelerated development with pre-built, accessible, production-ready elements.

**3. Blocks (Pattern Layer)**
Pre-composed sections combining multiple components into common UI patterns—hero sections, feature grids, pricing tables, testimonial layouts. Blocks are context-aware compositions that solve specific design problems.

*Value*: Rapid prototyping and consistent implementation of proven UX patterns across products.

**4. Templates (Page Layer)**
Complete page layouts that combine blocks into cohesive experiences—landing pages, dashboards, documentation sites. Templates demonstrate best-practice composition and provide production-ready starting points.

*Value*: Accelerated time-to-market with battle-tested layouts that maintain brand consistency.

### Design Philosophy
Each layer builds upon the previous, creating a systematic approach where changes cascade intelligently—updating a color token automatically refines all components, blocks, and templates that use it.

### Why This Resonates with CDOs
- **Strategic thinking**: Systematic approach to design at scale
- **Efficiency**: Reusability at every layer reduces redundancy
- **Flexibility**: Customizable at the foundation without rebuilding
- **Quality**: Accessibility and best practices baked in from the start

### Implementation Requirements

1) Must be built with existing Sage UI design token, components, blocks, and templates that are imported directly from '@thesage/ui'. We should "dog-food" everything. We must not write custom CSS or create custom components that aren't in the Sage UI library. Where there are key missing elements, components, or blocks, we should build them and add them to Sage UI. This includes dynamic Motion elements, of couse. 
2) Should visualize and present the Sage UI system in a beautiful, dynamic, and engaging way, including the thoughful use of animations. [Should not rely on static text and demand lots of reading.]
3) Must be clear, concise, and action-oriented, i.e., able to help the website visitor get up and running as quickly as possible. 
4) Should be stylistically cutting-edge, on par or excelling the quality of the inspirations on line 459 - 462 (and other relevant offerings).
5) Must not use http://localhost:3001/landing (as that's currently occupied with an early version that's sub-par, which you can review for reference, but which does not meet any of the above requirements). 

**Visual Design Inspiration:**
- https://ui.mantine.dev/ - Clean hierarchy, interactive demos
- https://chakra-ui.com/ - Component showcase, clear structure
- https://m3.material.io/ - Systematic thinking, design principles
- https://ui.shadcn.com/ - Modern aesthetic, developer-friendly

**Must-Have Elements:**
1. **Hero Section**
   - Clear headline conveying systematic design language
   - Visual diagram showing the 4-layer hierarchy
   - Primary CTA ("Get Started" / "Explore Components")
   - Secondary CTA ("View Templates" / "See Examples")
   Shalom's brainstorm on the animation for this section:
    - The idea of seeing design tokens assemble into compnents, which snap into blocks, which form into templates feels magical and novel.
    - Show an animation of nodes with clean Bezier curves that pipe into components. Colored dots traveling along these curves represent design token data that's informing the appearance of the components. Then, an animation to the right can show Components, once they're informed by the tokens, moving into shape into the shape of Blocks. Fitting almost Tetris-like. Then, to the right of that, the blocks group into Templates. And that would successfully visualize the 4-layer hierarchy. [And on mobile breakpoints, this shifts from a right-to-left layout to a top-to-bottom one.]

2. **The Four Layers Section**
   - Visual cards for each layer (Tokens → Components → Blocks → Templates)
   - Interactive preview showing how changes cascade through layers
   - Value proposition for each layer
   - Icon/illustration for each layer concept

3. **Live Examples**
   - Interactive component playground
   - Theme switcher showing dynamic theming in action
   - Before/after comparisons showing the power of token-based design
   - Real product examples built with Sage UI

4. **Key Features Grid**
   - Accessibility-first approach
   - Dynamic theming system
   - Responsive by default
   - Developer-friendly API
   - Production-ready components
   - Open source / MIT licensed

5. **Use Cases / Audience**
   - Not just for solopreneurs (broader appeal)
   - Design teams scaling design systems
   - Product teams shipping faster
   - Agencies building client projects
   - Startups needing production-ready UI

6. **Social Proof** (when available)
   - Built with Sage UI showcase
   - GitHub stars / npm downloads
   - Community testimonials

7. **Get Started Section**
   - Installation command
   - Quick start guide
   - Link to documentation
   - Link to component library

**Technical Requirements:**
- Must be responsive (mobile-first)
- Must demonstrate Sage UI's own components
- Must load quickly (<2s LCP)
- Must be accessible (WCAG AA minimum)
- Must include meta tags for social sharing
- Must have clear navigation to docs/components/templates

**Aesthetics:** 
- Glassmorphism (backdrop-blur), subtle borders, and hover lift effects.

**Content Goals:**
- Inspiring but not overwhelming
- Professional but approachable
- Technical but understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- Clear value proposition within 5 seconds
- Call-to-action within first screen

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Clear understanding of Sage UI structure within 30 seconds of landing
- [ ] Compelling reason to explore further (low bounce rate)
- [ ] Smooth path to documentation / getting started
- [ ] Appeals to both developers and design leadership
- [ ] Showcases visual quality and attention to detail
- [ ] Mobile experience as polished as desktop

## 🎨 GradientBuilder & GradientPicker Components
**Date Proposed:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Medium (Phase 2 - Post OpenGraphCard Quick Wins)

### Project Overview
Create specialized components for visual gradient design and customization, empowering creative professionals to design beautiful gradients without code. This embodies the "Lovable by Design" and "User Control & Freedom" principles by making gradient creation accessible, transparent, and delightful.

### Context & Motivation
The OpenGraphCard component now supports custom gradients via props, but requires developers to manually construct gradient objects. For creative users (designers, solopreneurs, content creators), we need a visual tool that:
- Makes gradient creation intuitive and fun
- Integrates with the existing color palette system
- Validates accessibility (WCAG contrast)
- Exports reusable presets
- Aligns with Sage UI's philosophy of empowering users

### Two Implementation Paths

---

## Option A: GradientPicker (Simpler, Faster)
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Value:** 80% of functionality, 30% of complexity

### Description
A simplified gradient customization component that provides curated presets and basic customization. Similar in UI pattern to the existing `ColorPicker` component.

### Component Structure
```
packages/ui/src/components/forms/GradientPicker.tsx
```

### Features
1. **Preset Gallery** (10-20 curated gradients)
   - Professional gradients (subtle, corporate)
   - Creative gradients (bold, artistic)
   - Theme-aware presets (Studio, Sage, Volt variants)
   - Each preset includes accessibility rating badge

2. **Simple Customization**
   - Two-color picker (start + end)
   - Type toggle (linear vs radial only)
   - Angle slider for linear (0-360°)
   - Position dropdown for radial (9 preset positions)

3. **Integration**
   - Pull colors from active theme palette
   - Access saved custom palettes
   - Real-time preview on target component
   - Copy CSS code button

4. **Accessibility Layer**
   - Live contrast checker (foreground text vs gradient)
   - WCAG AA/AAA badge display
   - Warning (not blocker) for low contrast
   - Auto-suggest accessible text colors

### Props API
```typescript
interface GradientPickerProps {
  value: GradientConfig;  // Current gradient
  onChange: (gradient: GradientConfig) => void;
  label?: string;
  description?: string;
  showPresets?: boolean;  // Default true
  allowCustom?: boolean;  // Default true
  maxColors?: number;  // Default 2 (start + end only)
  targetForeground?: string;  // For contrast checking
}
```

## Dependencies & Technical Considerations

### Existing Infrastructure to Leverage
- ✅ `ColorPicker` component (ready to use)
- ✅ `@dnd-kit/core` (already in project for drag-and-drop)
- ✅ Color utilities (`getContrastRatio`, `hexToHSL`, `generateColorScale`)
- ✅ Customizer Zustand store (for preset persistence)
- ✅ Theme system (Studio/Sage/Volt)
- ✅ Color palettes (`@thesage/tokens/color-palettes`)

### New Dependencies (if needed)
- None required for GradientPicker (Option A)
- Potentially canvas library for advanced preview features (Option B)

### Technical Constraints
1. **Satori Limitation**: OpenGraphCard uses inline styles (no CSS variables)
   - Solution: Gradient tools output explicit hex values
   - Generate CSS strings that work in Satori

2. **Performance**: Real-time gradient updates can be heavy
   - Solution: Debounce gradient calculations
   - Use `useMemo` for expensive computations
   - Optimize re-renders with React.memo

3. **Mobile UX**: Drag-and-drop on mobile is challenging
   - Solution: Alternative tap-and-slide controls
   - Dedicated mobile layout with larger touch targets

4. **Accessibility**: Gradients are inherently visual
   - Solution: Provide text alternatives
   - Ensure keyboard-only navigation works
   - Add screen reader announcements

### Design System Alignment
- Follow existing Sage UI patterns (Card, Button, Input)
- Use theme-aware colors (CSS variables)
- Respect motion preferences (`useMotionPreference`)
- Maintain consistent spacing (8px base unit)
- Use existing typography scale

---

## Philosophy Alignment Check

✅ **Lovable by Design**
- Visual, delightful interface that sparks joy
- Makes complex tasks (gradient creation) feel simple
- Polished animations and micro-interactions

✅ **User Control & Freedom**
- Full customization: presets OR manual design
- Save and reuse creations
- Export in multiple formats
- No forced workflows

✅ **Transparent by Design**
- Real-time preview of changes
- Clear accessibility feedback
- Explainable gradient parameters
- No hidden magic

✅ **Generous by Design**
- Curated presets to solve blank page problem
- Auto-accessible suggestions
- Share and export capabilities
- Teaching tool (learn color theory through use)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Decision Point**: Choose GradientPicker (A) or GradientBuilder (B)
2. **Spike**: 2-hour prototype of chosen approach
3. **Design Review**: Mockup UI in Figma (optional but recommended)
4. **Implementation**: Follow phased approach above
5. **User Testing**: Get feedback from 3-5 target users
6. **Iteration**: Refine based on feedback
7. **Documentation**: Write comprehensive docs
8. **Launch**: Announce to community
