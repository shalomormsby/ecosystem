# Creative Sandbox

A gallery application for code experiments, creative projects, and playful explorations. Built to make sharing and discovering creative coding experiments delightful and accessible.

## Purpose

The Creative Sandbox is a **community-driven playground** where developers, designers, and creative technologists can:

- **Share experiments** - Post your code explorations, creative projects, and prototypes
- **Discover inspiration** - Browse experiments by category (Games, Visualizations, Animations, Tools)
- **Learn by doing** - See how others approach creative coding challenges
- **Contribute easily** - Beginner-friendly GitHub workflow with step-by-step guidance

## What Makes It Special

### Inviting by Design
- **Simple architecture** - URL = folder structure, no complexity
- **Beginner-friendly** - Comprehensive contribution guide at `/contribute`
- **Quick start** - Just add a file and registry entry to publish an experiment

### Fully Themed
- Integrated with `@ecosystem/design-system`
- Real-time theme switching (Studio, Sage, Volt)
- Light/dark mode support
- Customizable typography, colors, and motion

### Organized & Discoverable
- **Category-based** - Games, Visualizations, Animations, Tools
- **Metadata-rich** - Tags, authors, descriptions for each experiment
- **Central registry** - Single source of truth for all experiments

## Quick Start

### Running Locally

```bash
# From repository root
pnpm install
pnpm --filter creative-powerup dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Adding an Experiment

1. **Create your experiment page**
   ```bash
   # Choose a category: games, visualizations, animations, tools
   apps/creative-powerup/app/[category]/[your-experiment]/page.tsx
   ```

2. **Add to the registry**
   ```typescript
   // apps/creative-powerup/lib/experiments.ts
   {
     slug: 'your-experiment',
     title: 'Your Experiment Title',
     category: 'games', // or visualizations, animations, tools
     description: 'What your experiment does',
     author: 'Your Name',
     path: '/games/your-experiment',
     dateAdded: '2025-12-17',
     tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
   }
   ```

3. **That's it!** Your experiment appears in the gallery automatically.

See `/contribute` for detailed step-by-step instructions.

### Design Philosophy

1. **URL = Folder Structure** - No `src/` complexity, what you see is what you get
2. **Registry-Driven** - Add once to `experiments.ts`, appears everywhere automatically
3. **Framework Integration** - Uses design-system for consistent theming across all apps
4. **Progressive Enhancement** - Works with pure HTML, enhances with React when needed

## Categories

### 🎮 Games
Playable interactive experiences. Examples:
- Galaga (arcade shooter)
- Tetris (puzzle game)
- 2v2 Soccer (multiplayer)

### 🌀 Visualizations
Mathematical and generative art. Examples:
- Fibonacci Spiral (sacred geometry)
- Hexagonal Grid (tiling patterns)

### ✨ Animations
Motion technique experiments. Examples:
- Kaleidoscope (interactive symmetry)

### 🔧 Tools
Functional utilities. Examples:
- Mayan Calendar Converter (cultural tool)
