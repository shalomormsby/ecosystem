# Sage Design System (SDS) vs Shadcn Parity Strategy

This document outlines the strategy to reach full feature parity with Shadcn/ui efficiently and ethically, while organizing the system for the long-term goal of enabling rapid development of complex applications.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning component migration, verify the following:

1. **Token Integration Automation**
   - Configure `components.json` (Shadcn CLI config) to automatically use SDS CSS variables
   - Update Shadcn's theme mapping to point to our existing tokens (e.g., `--color-primary`)
   - Test one component end-to-end to validate automated token mapping works
   - **Goal**: Zero manual token refactoring per component
   - Document the `components.json` configuration for reference

2. **Legacy Component Audit & CSS Isolation**
   - Identify all current usages of legacy components across the ecosystem
   - Document breaking changes for each migration
   - **Prevent CSS Conflicts**: Ensure legacy component styles are scoped (module CSS, unique class prefixes)
   - Verify no global style bleeding between legacy `Modal` and new `Dialog`, etc.
   - Consider namespacing legacy components (e.g., `.legacy-modal`) if conflicts arise

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Vitest + React Testing Library for unit tests
   - Configure accessibility testing with axe-core
   - Establish visual regression testing (Chromatic or Percy)

4. **Package Architecture**
   - Verify monorepo build configuration (Turborepo)
   - Ensure shared Radix UI version management across workspace
   - Set up independent semantic versioning for packages

## 1. Component State Analysis

## 2. Strategy for Efficient Parity

To efficiently reach parity while maintaining an "ethical" and high-quality codebase, we will adopt the following strategy:

### A. The "Adoption" Workflow (Ethical & Efficient)
Shadcn/ui is designed to be "owned" code, not a node_module dependency. This is the most ethical usage as it complies with their philosophy: copy, paste, and customize.

#### Component Addition Checklist

For each component added, follow this workflow:

1.  **Automated Ingestion**: Use the `shadcn` CLI to pull component code directly into `packages/ui`.
    ```bash
    cd packages/ui
    npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
    ```

2.  **Instant Refine**: Immediately refactor the added component:
    *   **Tokens**: Should be automatic via `components.json` config - verify it works, no manual changes needed
    *   **Exports**: Export the component from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`
    *   **Customize**: Apply SDS-specific defaults or styling if needed (document all deviations)

3.  **Testing**: Write tests based on phase requirements (see Staged Quality Gates)
    *   **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Critical path tests + accessibility tests with axe-core
    *   **Phase 2/3**: Same as Phase 1 (move fast, backfill later)
    *   **Post-Phase 3**: Backfill to 80% coverage + visual regression baseline

4.  **Documentation**:
    *   Add component to `apps/sage-design-studio/.../component-registry.tsx`
    *   Document API, props, and usage examples
    *   Note any customizations or deviations from Shadcn defaults

5.  **Review**: Code review focusing on:
    *   Token integration
    *   Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
    *   Browser compatibility
    *   Dark mode support

### B. Migration of Legacy Components

We currently have a split state between `packages/ui` (New) and `design-system` (Old).

**Migration Strategy:**
1.  **Freeze Legacy**: Stop adding to `design-system/atoms|molecules`
2.  **Isolate CSS**: Ensure legacy styles are scoped to prevent conflicts with new components (critical during Phases 1-5 when both exist)
3.  **Replace**: For items like `Modal` (Legacy), install Shadcn `Dialog` into `packages/ui` and deprecate the legacy `Modal`
4.  **Add Deprecation Warnings**: Update legacy components with console warnings pointing to new imports
5.  **Update Consumers**: Migrate all internal usage to `@sds/ui` imports
6.  **Breaking Change**: Remove legacy components in a major version bump with proper communication

**Legacy Components Requiring Migration:**
- Dialog (Modal) → `@sds/ui/dialog`
- Dropdown Menu → `@sds/ui/dropdown-menu`
- Form → `@sds/ui/form`
- Avatar → `@sds/ui/avatar`
- Breadcrumb → `@sds/ui/breadcrumb`
- Progress → `@sds/ui/progress`
- Tooltip → `@sds/ui/tooltip`
- Aspect Ratio (AspectImage) → `@sds/ui/aspect-ratio`

### C. Staged Quality Gates

To maximize velocity while maintaining quality, we use **staged quality gates** that increase rigor after core functionality is complete.

#### Phase 1-3: Velocity-Optimized Quality Gate

**Purpose**: Move fast, ship components, get them in use
**Requirements:**

**Accessibility (Non-negotiable):**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Passing axe-core automated tests

**Testing (Critical Path Only):**
- Test primary user interactions (click, type, submit, etc.)
- Test accessibility with axe-core
- Test dark mode support
- **No coverage requirement** - focus on critical paths
- **No visual regression** - defer until Post-Phase 3

**Browser Support:**
- Manual testing in Chrome + Safari (primary browsers)
- Defer exhaustive cross-browser testing

**Design System Integration:**
- Uses SDS design tokens (automated via `components.json`)
- Supports light and dark modes
- Consistent API patterns with existing components

**Documentation (Lightweight):**
- Add to component registry with basic example
- Document props and variants
- Defer comprehensive docs

#### Post-Phase 3: Backfill Quality Gate

**Purpose**: Harden components for production, increase confidence

**Testing Backfill:**
- Increase coverage to 80% across all components
- Test all interactive states and edge cases
- Establish visual regression baseline (Chromatic/Percy)
- Add integration tests for complex components

**Browser Support Backfill:**
- Test in Firefox, Edge, mobile browsers
- Fix cross-browser issues

**Documentation Backfill:**
- Add comprehensive usage examples
- Document all props with descriptions
- Add accessibility usage notes
- Create migration guides for legacy replacements

**Rationale**: This approach prevents testing overhead from blocking component availability in Phases 1-3, while ensuring we don't ship inaccessible or broken components. We backfill comprehensive testing once all primitives exist.

## 3. Organization Proposal

To scale from "Lego blocks" to "Solopreneur Templates", we should organize the library into three distinct tiers.

### Tier 1: Primitives (The "Parts")
*Location: `@sds/ui` (and Shadcn parity)*
These are the dumb, stateless, accessible building blocks.
*   *Examples*: Button, Input, Dialog, Switch, Card.
*   *Goal*: 100% Shadcn parity.

### Tier 2: Assemblies (The "Modules")
*Location: `@sds/assemblies` (New Package Proposal)*
These are functional, feature-ready compositions of Primitives. They solve a specific UI problem.
*   *Examples*: `LoginForm`, `CreditCardForm`, `PricingTable`, `CookieConsent`, `CommentSection`.
*   *Value*: This is where the "speed" comes from. A user doesn't just want a `Input` and a `Button`; they want a `NewsletterSignup`.

### Tier 3: Templates (The "Blueprints")
*Location: `@sds/templates`*
Full page layouts or entire app shells.
*   *Examples*: `SaaSDashboardDetails`, `MarketingLandingPage`, `SettingsLayout`.

## 4. Phased Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Components + Foundation

## 6. Customization Principles

When adapting Shadcn components for SDS:

**Prefer Composition Over Modification:**
- Build on top of Shadcn primitives rather than modifying internals
- Use wrapper components for SDS-specific behavior

**Maintain Radix Primitives Unchanged:**
- Don't modify underlying Radix UI components
- Keep accessibility features intact

**Styling Guidelines:**
- Use SDS design tokens for all styling
- Customize only visual appearance and defaults
- Maintain responsive behavior patterns

**Document All Deviations:**
- Note why customization was needed
- Document impact on upgradability
- Provide migration path for future Shadcn updates

**Upgradability Strategy:**
- Keep customizations minimal to ease upstream syncing
- Tag customized sections in code with `// SDS-specific`
- Periodically review Shadcn updates for improvements
