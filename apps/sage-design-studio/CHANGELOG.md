### Fixed

#### Critical Registry Issues
- **Input component missing** from Studio registry
  - Component was exported from `@sds/ui` ✓
  - Component was in navigation list ✓
  - Component was NOT in component registry ✗
  - Impact: HIGH - Input is a fundamental form component
  - Resolution: Added comprehensive 99-line registry entry


- **Label component missing** from Studio registry
  - Component was exported from `@sds/ui` ✓
  - Component was in navigation list ✓
  - Component was NOT in component registry ✗
  - Impact: HIGH - Label is essential for accessible forms (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Resolution: Added comprehensive 86-line registry entry

#### Build & Infrastructure Fixes
- **Functional Organization Build Repairs**
  - **Issue:** `@sds/ui` build failing after massive refactor due to import path and prop errors.
  - **Resolution:**
    - `packages/ui/src/lib/store/theme.ts`: Fixed import path from `../tokens` to `@sds/tokens` workspace package.
    - `packages/ui/src/components/forms/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`: Removed unsupported `size` prop from `Switch` component.
    - `packages/ui/src/components/feedback/Toast.tsx`: Deleted duplicate file (conflicting with `Toast/Toast.tsx`).
    - `packages/ui/src/index.ts` & `src/components/feedback/index.ts`: Removed duplicate exports for Toast component.
    - `apps/sage-design-studio`: Resolved all TypeScript build errors in `component-registry.tsx`, `HooksSection.tsx`, and `universal/page.tsx` by migrating imports and adding required props to satisfy strict types.
    - `packages/design-system`: Updated legacy `Card` component to disable `hoverEffect` by default, resolving UI inconsistencies in the "Adding Components" section.

### Changed

#### Component Updates
- **Card Component**
  - Changed default `hoverEffect` from `true` to `false`.
  - Effect: Cards no longer elevate on hover by default, removing false interaction affordance.
  - Opt-in: Explicitly pass `hoverEffect={true}` to restore the elevation animation.
  - Updated Component Registry documentation and examples to match new default.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-07

### Added - SDS Cross-Platform Architecture (Phase 1)
- **New Monorepo Strategy (The "Sage Stack")**
  - **`@sds/tokens`**: New dedicated workspace for universal design tokens. Extracted from `design-system` to serve as the single source of truth for Web and Mobile.
  - **`@sds/config`**: New shared configuration workspace (Tailwind, etc.).
  - **`SDS_MASTER_PLAN.md`**: Comprehensive roadmap and migration strategy documentation.

### Changed
- **`design-system` Refactor**:
  - Now consumes tokens from `@sds/tokens` instead of local files.
  - Removed legacy token files (`base.ts`, `colors.json`, etc.) to enforce the new architecture.
  - Updated `package.json` to use workspace protocol: `"@sds/tokens": "workspace:*"`.

### Added - Universal UI (Phase 2)
- **`@sds/ui` Workspace**:
  - Initialized with `nativewind` v4, `react-native-web`, and `@rn-primitives`.
  - Configured tailwind preset to consume `@sds/tokens`.
  - **Universal Button**: Created first cross-platform component (`src/components/Button.tsx`) using `Pressable` and `Slot` pattern.
  - **Universal Test Page**: Added `/universal` route in Sage Design Studio to verify the button.

### Added - Mobile Entry (Phase 3)
- **`apps/mobile`**:
  - Initialized Expo (Managed) project with TypeScript.
  - Configured **Metro** for monorepo resolution (handling workspace packages).
  - Configured **NativeWind v4** with `babel` and `tailwind.config.js`.
  - Consumes `@sds/ui` and `@sds/tokens` directly.
  - Added Universal Button demo to `App.tsx`.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-05

### Changed
- **Icon System Migration**
  - Replaced all direct emoji usage with `lucide-react` icons for consistency and accessibility.
  - **Sidebar:** Updated navigation icons (BookOpen, Palette, Component, Webhook, LayoutTemplate).
  - **Documentation:** Replaced status flags (✅/❌) with CheckCircle/XCircle in `MotionFoundationsSection`.
  - **Accessibility:** Replaced wheelchair emoji (♿) with Accessibility icon.
  - **Component Demos:** Replaced emojis in `TypographyTab`, `OrganismsSection`, `TextEffectsSection`.
  - **Architecture:** Replaced text arrows with proper ArrowRight icons.
  - **Sections Updated:** `OverviewSection`, `ContributingSection`, `TemplatesSection`, `TypographyTab`, `OrganismsSection`, `TextEffectsSection`, `MotionFoundationsSection`.

### Fixed
- **Mobile Responsive Layout**
  - **Issue:** Severe horizontal scrolling and content overflow on mobile viewports due to unconstrained flex containers and code blocks.
  - **Root Cause:** Deeply nested flex containers in section components (`AddingComponentsSection`, `OrganismsSection`, etc.) were missing `min-w-0` and `w-full` constraints. Specifically, `flex-1` containers within list items (`li`) would refuse to shrink below the intrinsic width of their children (code blocks with long paths), forcing the parent card to expand beyond the viewport.
  - **Fix:** Systemically applied the "Flatten & Clamp" strategy:
    - Added `w-full min-w-0` to the root container of all studio sections:
      - `AddingComponentsSection`
      - `ArchitectureSection`
      - `CommonPatternsSection`
      - `HooksSection`
      - `MoleculesSection`
      - `OrganismsSection`
      - `TemplatesSection`
      - `TokensSection`
    - **Crucial:** Added `min-w-0` to all `flex-1` containers in list items to allow flex shrinking.
    - Constrained `CollapsibleCodeBlock` internal containers with `w-full max-w-full` in the design system to ensure independent responsiveness.
    - Added `overflow-x-hidden` to the main page layout to prevent global scroll leaks.
    - Fixed `portfolio` build failure by exporting `SearchInput` from `design-system`.
  - **Outcome:** Zero horizontal scroll on mobile. Content now correctly shrinks to fit the viewport, and code blocks trigger their own internal scrollbars instead of breaking the page layout.
- **Sticky Navigation Restoration**
  - **Issue:** Sticky headers (`SecondaryNav`, `TertiaryNav`) stopped sticking due to `overflow-x-hidden` applied to `PageLayout` container during mobile responsive fixes.
  - **Fix:** Removed `overflow-x-hidden` from `PageLayout` and `StudioPage` containers. Horizontal overflow protection is now handled exclusively by the `body` element constraints.
- **Component Architecture Refactor**
  - **Issue:** Several components (`NavigationFallback`, `SecondaryNav`, `TertiaryNav`) relied on manual utility classes instead of atomic components, violating design system principles.
  - **Fix:** Refactored these components to use `Heading`, `Text`, `Button`, and `FilterButton` strictly.
  - **Enhancement:** Added `variant="link"` to `Button` and `shape` prop to `FilterButton` to support these patterns natively.
