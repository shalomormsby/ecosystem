All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

**Last updated:** 2026-02-15 3:45 PM PST

## 2026-02-15 3:45 PM PST — Phase 15: Test Coverage Expansion

### Test Suite Growth: 63 → 156 Tests (10 → 30 Files)

- Added 20 new test files covering components across all functional categories:
  - **actions:** Toggle (pressed state, onChange, disabled, custom className, aria-pressed, group rendering)
  - **data-display:** Badge, Avatar, Heading, Text (variants, fallback behavior, semantic HTML, className forwarding)
  - **feedback:** Alert, Skeleton, Spinner (roles, variants, descriptions, accessibility attributes)
  - **forms:** Checkbox, Textarea, Label (checked state, onChange, disabled, ref forwarding, htmlFor association)
  - **overlays:** AlertDialog, Tooltip, Popover (trigger rendering, open/close, controlled state)
  - **navigation:** Breadcrumb (nav role, links with href, aria-current for current page)
  - **layout:** Separator, Collapsible, Stack, Grid, Container (orientation, open/close, responsive props, semantic elements)
- Fixed Radix-specific testing patterns:
  - Avatar: jsdom doesn't fire image load events — test fallback behavior instead
  - Collapsible: Radix removes content from DOM when closed (use `not.toBeInTheDocument()` not `not.toBeVisible()`)
  - Tooltip: content renders with `role="tooltip"` — use `findByRole` instead of `findByText`
- All 156 tests passing, 0 failures

## 2026-02-15 3:38 PM PST — Post-Audit Fix Phases (9A–14)

### Phase 9A: Fix "Documentation - undefined" Title (P0)

- Fixed `og:title` and `twitter:title` rendering "Documentation - undefined" on `/docs`
- Root cause: tsup's blanket `"use client"` banner makes `BRAND` from `@thesage/ui` resolve to `undefined` in server metadata contexts
- Fix: Replaced `BRAND.productName` import with local `PRODUCT_NAME` constant in `apps/web/app/docs/layout.tsx`
- Also fixed the same issue in root `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` (was silently broken there too)

### Phase 9C: Update npm Description (P0)

- Updated `packages/ui/package.json` description from "48+ accessible components" to "92 accessible React components"

### Phase 9D: Fix Catch-All Route Missing Sections (P1)

- Added `getting-started`, `tools`, `backgrounds`, `cursor` to `validSections` in `apps/web/app/[...slug]/page.tsx`
- These sections now correctly redirect to `/docs#section` instead of returning 404

### Phase 10: Create /docs/api.json Endpoint (P1)

- Created `apps/web/app/docs/api.json/route.ts` — Next.js API route returning full component catalog as JSON
- Returns: name, version, totalComponents, package, install, docs, llmsFullTxt, mcp, themes, categories (11), components (92 with full props)
- CORS enabled (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) with cache headers and OPTIONS preflight handler
- Added `./registry` subpath export to `@thesage/mcp` package (separate tsup entry, 358B) so web app can import registry data without triggering MCP server startup
- Added `@thesage/mcp` as workspace dependency to web app, added to `transpilePackages`
- Documented endpoint in `llms.txt` and `robots.txt`

### Phase 11: Add sitemap.xml lastmod Dates (P1)

- Added `<lastmod>` ISO 8601 dates to all entries in `apps/web/public/sitemap.xml`
- Added missing section URLs: `#backgrounds`, `#cursor`, `/docs/api.json`
- Used specific dates: `2026-02-15` for recently updated sections, `2026-01-26` for stable sections

### Phase 12: .well-known/ AI Discovery Files (P1)

- Created `apps/web/public/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` — OpenAI plugin manifest standard (schema_version, name_for_model, description_for_model, api, auth, logo, contact)
- Created `apps/web/public/.well-known/mcp-server.json` — MCP server discovery (name, version, description, source, repository, install config, 4 tool descriptions)
- Referenced both files in `robots.txt`

### Phase 13: Enhance Starter Template (P2)

- Added `CustomizerPanel` to main page — floating theme/mode/motion controls
- Added `useTheme()` + `useMotionPreference()` hook demos with live state badges
- Added motion-aware title animation using `shouldAnimate` and `scale`
- Created `templates/nextjs-app/app/form/page.tsx` — react-hook-form + zod validated contact form (Input, Textarea, Select, toast feedback)
- Updated template `package.json`: added framer-motion, react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, zod

### Phase 14: Root Page SEO & Structured Data (P2)

- Added `Organization` JSON-LD schema to root layout (name, url, logo, description, sameAs: GitHub + npm)
- Added `CollectionPage` JSON-LD to docs layout (numberOfItems: 92, 7 category descriptions, SoftwareSourceCode mainEntity)
- Added `canonical` link and `keywords` meta tag (12 terms) to root metadata
- Upgraded root description from tagline to full product description

**Plan document:** `docs/SDE-3RD-PARTY-OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md` — Phases 9A–14 complete, P3 phases (15–18) remaining.

## 2026-02-15 (continued)

### Version Bumps (for CI/CD changeset)

- **`@thesage/mcp`**: 0.4.0 → **0.5.0** (minor) — Full props coverage for all 92 components, formatComponentDetails enriched output
- **`@thesage/ui`**: 1.0.0 → **1.0.1** (patch) — Ships `.claude/CLAUDE.md` AI context file in npm package, no API changes

### Phase 8: MCP Props Completeness

- Enriched all 92 components in `@thesage/mcp` registry with props, subComponents, and usage examples. Previously only ~23 had props data; now 100% coverage.
- Component enrichments include: prop types, defaults, descriptions, required flags, sub-component lists, and JSX examples for every component.
- MCP server bundle grew from 66KB to 94KB. Build verified.

### Phase 7: Quick DX & Documentation Wins

- Shipped `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in `@thesage/ui` npm package — AI context file auto-discovered in `node_modules` by Claude and other AI tools. Added to `files` array in package.json.
- Added third-party pairing docs to `llms-full.txt` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — recommended libraries for gaps (Tiptap, react-dropzone, Recharts, react-colorful, react-markdown, @tanstack/react-virtual, XState) with integration patterns.
- Documented per-entrypoint bundle sizes (from `size-limit`) and tree-shaking support in both `llms-full.txt` and `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. All 10 entrypoints well under limits (core: 146KB/450KB).

- `apps/web/public/llms-full.txt` — Complete ~800-line component API reference with all 92 components, props, examples, composition patterns, design tokens, and hooks. One fetch = full knowledge.
- `apps/web/public/robots.txt` — Allows all crawlers (ClaudeBot, GPTBot, Google-Extended), references sitemap and llms.txt
- `apps/web/public/sitemap.xml` — 25 URLs covering all doc sections and LLM-optimized content
- `apps/web/app/docs/layout.tsx` — Server-side metadata for /docs route (title, OG tags, `sage:llms-full` meta tag)
- `templates/nextjs-app/` — General-purpose Next.js App Router starter template with correct provider hierarchy, Tailwind config, globals.css, and example page using SDE components

**MCP Server (v0.3.0 → v0.4.0):**

- Added `PropInfo` interface and `props`, `subComponents`, `example` fields to `ComponentMetadata`
- Enriched ~25 high-frequency components with full props data (Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Card, Badge, Tabs, Switch, Checkbox, Combobox, Slider, RadioGroup, Textarea, Form, Accordion, Separator, Sidebar, Alert, Skeleton, DropdownMenu, Sheet, AlertDialog, Popover, Tooltip, Toggle, ToggleGroup)
- Updated `formatComponentDetails()` to render props table, sub-components list, code examples, and llms-full.txt link
- Version bumped to 0.4.0

**AGENTS.md updates:**

- Added "Component Quick Reference" section with 30 high-frequency components (category, key props, import path)
- Added provider hierarchy diagram
- Added common composition recipes (settings page, data table, form page, dashboard, confirmation flow)
- Added reference to starter template

**Plan document:** `docs/SDE-SPEEDBOAT-OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md` — Full implementation tracker with checkboxes and out-of-scope items for future work.

### Brand Refresh: "Sage — Make it Lovable"

We stepped back and asked: *what does this project actually say to someone landing on thesage.dev for the first time?*

The old hero — "The Solopreneur's Development Stack" — was honest, but it was playing small. An enterprise was already evaluating Sage for production use. Solopreneurs were building with it. The positioning didn't match the ambition.

So we rethought the entire top-fold messaging. Not a cosmetic refresh — a strategic one.

**The insight:** Sage isn't defined by who uses it. It's defined by what it stands for. "Lovable by Design" isn't a tagline — it's the philosophy that already runs through every component, every motion preference check, every theme personality. We just hadn't said it out loud yet.

**What changed:**

- **Hero headline** — Replaced "The Solopreneur's Development Stack" with a two-line treatment: "Sage" (enormous, gradient) + "Make it Lovable" (bold, white). Brand-first, promise-second.
- **Badge** — "Human Touch x AI Power" → "Lovable by Design". Anchors the philosophy without being preachy.
- **Sub copy** — "Ship stunning, full-stack web applications faster..." → "Components that feel alive. Themes with real personality. Motion your users control. Designed for humans. Fluent with AI." Five punchy fragments that earn credibility through specificity.
- **Typewriter** — "Build smarter with Sage Design Engine" → "Build beautifully with Sage Design Engine" + cycling through the four-layer hierarchy: Tokens. Components. Blocks. Templates.
- **Metadata** — Updated page title, OpenGraph, and Twitter cards to "Sage — Make it Lovable" across all social sharing surfaces.

**Why it matters:** The old copy described a category ("development stack"). The new copy describes an outcome ("make it lovable"). That's a fundamentally different conversation — one that resonates whether you're a solo builder, a startup team, or an enterprise design org.

**Technical details:**
- Fixed "g" descender clipping in oversized headline (`leading-none pb-2` for `bg-clip-text` compatibility)
- Added `pt-24` to hero container to clear sticky nav without breaking vertical centering
- All changes in `SageHero.tsx`, `landing/layout.tsx` metadata
- Build verified: 8/8 static pages, zero errors

---

### Documentation Audit & v1.0.0-rc.1 Content Update

Comprehensive sweep of all user-facing content on thesage.dev and linked documentation files to align with v1.0.0-rc.1.

**Branding fixes (20+ files):**
- "Sage UI" → "Sage Design Engine" across all web app pages, metadata, JSON-LD, search index, MCP docs, error/404 pages
- Theme "Sage" → "Terra" in all documentation and UI (reflecting the Jan 2026 rename to avoid product/theme name collision)
- Copyright dates updated to 2026

**Technical accuracy fixes:**
- React 18 → React 19 references in OverviewSection, ArchitectureSection
- `forwardRef` → ref-as-prop guidance in AddingComponentsSection, component-registry
- Next.js 14+ → 15+ in prerequisites
- Testing status updated from "not yet configured" to "Vitest + Testing Library, 63 tests, CI-enforced" in CLAUDE.md

**Documentation files updated:**
- README.md — Theme name, React version, Status & Roadmap section rewritten for v1.0.0-rc.1
- SAGE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_STRATEGY.md — Title, vision, testing section, timestamps

- Tests and bundle size checks run in CI on every PR

**Phase 3: Dependency Optimization**
- Vendored OGL WebGL library with clean-room TypeScript implementations (80 KB → 1.1 KB, 93% reduction)
- Created 5 optional subpath exports: `@thesage/ui/forms`, `/dates`, `/tables`, `/dnd`, `/webgl`

### ✅ Standardized Breadcrumb Placement

**Fixed systemic inconsistency in breadcrumb hierarchy across documentation**

Audit revealed that breadcrumbs were inconsistently placed (sometimes below title, sometimes above) and handled redundantly by parent components. This update unifies the UX by ensuring breadcrumbs always appear at the very top of the content area.

**Key Changes:**

**1. Hierarchy Standardization**
- **Rule:** Breadcrumbs > Title > Description > Content.
- **Implementation:** Moved breadcrumb rendering block to the top of the header `div` in all section components.
- **Affected Sections:** `ArchitectureSection`, `AddingComponentsSection`, `CommonPatternsSection`, `ContributingSection`.

**2. Component Delegation**
- **Refactor:** Removed breadcrumb rendering from parent `GettingStartedSection`.
- **Logic:** Child components now strictly handle their own breadcrumbs, preventing duplication and state mismatches.
- **Benefit:** Cleaner prop drilling and reliable rendering regardless of routing depth.

**3. Verification:**
- ✅ Validated breadcrumb placement in all documentation sections.
- ✅ Confirmed `DocsPage` passes props correctly.
- ✅ Fixed specific duplication in `ToolsSection` / `ChartsSections`.

---

### ✅ Ecosystem-Wide Branding Update: Sage Design Engine & Terra Theme

**Strategic realignment of product identity and theme nomenclature**

Executed a comprehensive branding update to position the ecosystem as a "Design Engine" rather than just a UI library, and resolved naming collisions between the product and its default theme.

**Key Changes:**

**1. Product Rename: "Sage Design Engine"**
- Transitioned user-facing branding from "Sage UI" to "Sage Design Engine".
- **Tokenized Branding:** Refactored product name into a single "Source of Truth" design token (`BRAND.productName`) in `component-registry.ts`.
  - Implements "Change once, ripple everywhere" philosophy for brand identity.
  - Consumed by `OverviewSection`, `SageHero`, `page.tsx` (header), and `layout.tsx` (metadata).
- Updated Landing Page hero, window metadata, OpenGraph tags, and main Overview heading.
- **Why:** "UI Library" implies a static kit. "Design Engine" accurately reflects the architectural capabilities (Tokens → Primitives → Patterns → Archetypes) and AI-native nature of the system.
- **Note:** npm packages purposefully remain `@thesage/*` for stability and brand consistency.
- **Documentation:** Added new "Brand" tab to Design Tokens section, documenting the token and implementation philosophy.

**2. Theme Rename: "Terra" (formerly Sage)**
- Renamed the default organic theme from "Sage" to "Terra".
- Updated all code references: `sageTokens` → `terraTokens`, CSS variables `--font-sage-*` → `--font-terra-*`.
- Updated Customizer and Theme Switcher UIs.
- **Why:** Distinguishes the *content* (Terra: earthy, organic) from the *container* (Sage: the engine itself).

**3. Verification:**
- ✅ Validated full build (`pnpm build`).
- ✅ Verified Customizer theme switching works.
- ✅ Verified fonts load correctly with new variable names.
- ✅ Confirmed Landing Page and Documentation reflect new naming.

## 2026-01-27T22:00:00Z

### ✅ Completed Standardized Overview Pages & Templates

**Implemented "Change Once, Ripple Everywhere" architecture for documentation pages**

TRANSFORMATIVE UPDATE: Replaced ad-hoc overview pages with a standardized, template-driven architecture. This ensures every section of the documentation (Getting Started, Design Tokens, Themes, Tools, MCP, Templates) follows a coherent visual language and structure, while dramatically reducing maintenance overhead.

**What Was Built:**

**1. Reusable Layout Templates**
- **SectionOverview.tsx**: Smart template component that standardizes page layout:
  - Header with icon, dynamic badges, and title
  - Description text area
  - Grid navigation for child pages (automatically rendered as clickable cards)
  - Resources section support
- **SectionOverviewSimple.tsx**: Lightweight variant for informational content without complex navigation.

**2. Standardized Overview Pages**
Refactored all major section roots to use the new templates:
- **DesignTokensOverview.tsx**: 5 token categories (Colors, Typography, etc.)
- **ThemesOverview.tsx**: Theme features and capabilities
- **ToolsOverview.tsx**: Brand Builder, Open Graph Card, Charts
- **TemplatesOverview.tsx**: Swiss Grid principles and page templates
- **McpOverview.tsx**: Rich content with Features, Documentation, and Resources
- **GettingStartedOverview.tsx**: 5-step documentation journey

**3. Application Architecture Updates**
- **Navigation Tree**: 
  - Added `section` attributes to all top-level items for active state tracking
  - Cleaned up routing (removed redundant "Overview" children)
  - Moved "Brand Builder" from Templates → Tools
- **Routing**:
  - Updated `page.tsx` to handle new Getting Started routing
  - Configured route mapping for all new overview components

**4. Design System Consumption (Dog-fooding)**
- All new pages use 100% Sage UI components (`Heading`, `Text`, `Card`, `Badge`)
- Strict adherence to design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Removed all hardcoded styles in favor of system utilities

**Why This Matters:**
This update validates the "Sage UI" strategic value proposition. By using a single `SectionOverview` template, we have:
1. **Unified the User Experience**: Every section feels part of the same family.
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Updating the `SectionOverview` design instantly updates 6+ major pages.
3. **Improved Navigation**: Consistent grid layouts make exploring sub-sections intuitive.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Static pages generated (8/8)
- ✅ Routing verified for all sections
- ✅ Responsive design tested

### ✅ Completed Phase 2 - Important Improvements

**Four critical documentation improvements to enhance user experience and reduce setup friction**

Successfully completed Phase 2 of the documentation audit (4 out of 5 issues - Issue #8 was already 90% complete from Phase 0.3), focusing on pedagogical clarity, troubleshooting support, user journey guidance, and local development enablement.

**What Was Completed:**

**1. Issue #7: Component-First Callout Context Enhancement**
- **Problem:** Callout appeared early in Philosophy section without sufficient context, felt preachy
- **Solution:** Enhanced with "WHY this matters" explanation and specific benefits list:
  - ✅ Ensures consistency - Impossible to use wrong token combinations
  - ✅ Simplifies API - `<Text>` instead of `text-[var(--color-text-primary)]`
  - ✅ Enables smart defaults - Components choose appropriate tokens automatically
  - ✅ Improves DX - TypeScript autocomplete for semantic props
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines ~363-406)
- **Impact:** Users now understand the architectural rationale before seeing prescriptive do/don't examples

**2. Issue #9: Comprehensive Troubleshooting Section**
- **Problem:** Troubleshooting section was a stub with only external link, no inline help
- **Solution:** Expanded with 4 common issues, each with symptoms/causes/solutions:
  1. **Components are Unstyled** - Tailwind config, ThemeProvider, CSS loading
  2. **Motion/Animations Not Working** - ThemeProvider, motion preference, system settings
  3. **TypeScript Errors on Import** - Package installation, build process, import paths
  4. **Peer Dependency Warnings** - Missing React and Framer Motion
- Added "Still Having Issues?" section with links to Usage Guide, GitHub Issues, and Discussions
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines ~1533-1640)
- **Impact:** Zero-context users can self-diagnose and fix common setup issues without external support

**3. Gap #1: Next Steps Section After Setup**
- **Problem:** Documentation ended after Step 5 with no guidance on what to do next
- **Solution:** Added comprehensive "Next Steps" section with 4 action items:
  1. **Explore Components** - Links to all 7 functional categories
  2. **Try the Customizer** - Code example with `<CustomizerPanel />`
  3. **Read the Usage Guide** - Architecture and best practices
  4. **Build Something!** - Simple dashboard example code
- Added "Need Help?" footer with links to documentation, issues, discussions
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (after Step 5, before Documentation & Resources section)
- **Impact:** Clear user journey from setup to first real component, reduces drop-off after installation

**4. Gap #3: MCP Local Development Setup**
- **Problem:** MCP docs only covered published package, no local development workflow for contributors
- **Solution:** Added complete "Local Development Setup" section with 6 steps:
  1. Clone the Repository
  2. Install Dependencies
  3. Build the MCP Server
  4. Configure Your Client (Claude Desktop and Cursor configs with absolute paths)
  5. Restart Your Client (specific instructions per client)
  6. Verify Connection (test query)
- Added "Making Changes" section with rebuild workflow and watch mode
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/InstallationTab.tsx` (new section at end)
- **Impact:** Contributors can now test MCP changes locally, enabling community contributions

**Note on Issue #8 (Tailwind Configuration):**
Issue #8 from Phase 2 spec was already 90% complete from Phase 0.3 work:
- Prerequisites section with system requirements ✅
- Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS with complete config example ✅
- Content paths documented ✅
- CSS variables automatic injection noted ✅
- Only missing piece: Optional "Custom Tailwind Integration" section (low priority)

**Why This Matters:**

Phase 2 addresses critical gaps in the user journey:
- **Pedagogical:** Component-First Callout now educates rather than prescribes
- **Self-Service Support:** Inline troubleshooting reduces support burden and friction
- **User Journey:** Next Steps bridges the gap between setup and building real features
- **Contributor Enablement:** Local dev setup opens MCP server to community contributions

These improvements move Sage UI documentation from "technically accurate" (Phase 0/1) to "genuinely helpful" (Phase 2), reducing time-to-first-success and enabling user autonomy.

**Technical Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
1. `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`
   - Enhanced Component-First Architecture callout with benefits list
   - Expanded Troubleshooting section with 4 inline common issues
   - Added Next Steps section with 4 action items and code examples

2. `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/InstallationTab.tsx`
   - Added complete Local Development Setup section
   - 6-step workflow with code examples for each step
   - Client-specific config examples (Claude Desktop, Cursor)
   - Development workflow guidance (rebuild + watch mode)

**Documentation Coverage:**
- Total additions: ~250 lines of documentation across 2 files
- Code examples added: 6 (Customizer, Build example, Local clone/build, Config examples)
- Common issues documented: 4 with symptoms/causes/solutions
- Next steps provided: 4 actionable pathways

**Verification:**
- Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- All code examples use correct import paths

### ✅ Completed Phase 1.6 - Motion System Full Documentation

**Comprehensive explanation of the 0-10 motion scale system with accessibility features and usage guidance**

Successfully completed Phase 1.6 of the documentation audit, adding detailed documentation of the motion system that was previously only shown via code example without explanation.

**What Was Added:**

**1. Understanding the Motion System Section**
- Clear explanation of the 0-10 motion scale concept
- Emphasis on user control and fine-grained customization
- Accessibility-first messaging

**2. Motion Scale Table**
- Comprehensive 5-row table documenting all scale ranges:
  - **Scale 0**: No animations (instant state changes) - For vestibular disorders, motion sensitivity
  - **Scale 1-3**: Subtle animations (~100-200ms) - For minimal, professional interfaces
  - **Scale 5**: Balanced animations (default) - For general purpose, most users
  - **Scale 7-9**: Expressive animations - For engaging, playful interfaces
  - **Scale 10**: Maximum animation intensity - For highly interactive, game-like experiences
- Each row shows: scale value, behavior, and use case
- Clean, accessible table format matching ThemeProvider props table

**3. Automatic Accessibility Callout**
- Green-tinted success box with checkmark icon
- Key accessibility features:
  - Automatic respect for `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
  - `shouldAnimate` returns `false` when scale is 0 OR system preference is reduce
  - Motion scale 0 must work perfectly (no broken layouts or missing UI states)
  - No additional code needed - the hook handles everything
- Emphasizes accessibility as built-in, not opt-in

**4. How Users Set Motion Preferences Section**
- Three documented methods with priority ordering:

  **Method 1: The Customizer Component (Recommended)**
  - Code example showing `<CustomizerPanel />` integration
  - Described as floating panel with motion slider
  - Easiest method for end users
  - Collapsible code block for cleaner presentation

  **Method 2: Programmatically via Hook**
  - Code example showing custom range input implementation
  - Uses `setMotionPreference()` from `useMotionPreference()` hook
  - For developers who want custom UI
  - Collapsible code block

  **Method 3: System Preference (Automatic)**
  - Explains OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion` support
  - Notes that system setting overrides scale value
  - Happens automatically with no user action needed

**5. Persistence Note**
- Documents localStorage persistence
- Preferences sync across browser sessions
- Stored in customizer state

**6. Implementation Status Caveat (Added)**
- Yellow warning box about current implementation status
- Notes that API is complete but only subset of components use it
- Sets correct expectations for users and developers
- Aligns with "Transparent by Design" philosophy
- Honest about ongoing integration work

**Why This Matters:**
The motion system is a critical differentiator for Sage UI - it's not just "respect prefers-reduced-motion," it's a full 0-10 scale that gives users granular control. This documentation explains the philosophy and practical implementation, making it clear that accessibility is built-in from the start. The transparent note about partial implementation sets honest expectations while guiding developers toward best practices.

**Technical Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines 1284-1447)
  - Added ~163 lines of comprehensive documentation
  - Added to Step 5: Control themes and motion
  - Positioned after `useMotionPreference()` code example
  - Includes motion scale table, accessibility callout, and 3 usage methods
  - 2 collapsible code blocks for detailed examples

### ✅ Completed Phase 1.5 - ThemeProvider Props Documentation

**Comprehensive documentation of ThemeProvider API with accurate prop table and usage guidance**

Successfully completed Phase 1.5 of the documentation audit, correcting inaccurate code examples and adding complete documentation for the ThemeProvider component.

**What Was Fixed:**

**1. Corrected Code Example**
- Removed non-existent props from example (`defaultTheme`, `defaultMode`)
- Updated to show accurate minimal usage: `<ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>`
- Example now matches actual implementation in `packages/ui/src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`

**2. Added Props Table**
- Comprehensive table documenting the single required prop: `children`
- Clean, accessible table format with columns: Prop, Type, Required, Description
- Uses design system components (Code, Badge) for consistency

**3. Added "Default Theme & Mode" Section**
- Documents actual defaults from theme store: `theme: "volt"`, `mode: "dark"`
- Explains localStorage persistence behavior
- Key: `"ecosystem-theme"`

**4. Added "Programmatic Control" Section**
- Shows how to use `useTheme()` hook to set initial theme/mode
- Complete code example with `useEffect` pattern for setting on mount
- Collapsible code block for better UX

**5. Added "Available Options" Section**
- Lists all 3 themes: `"studio"`, `"sage"`, `"volt"`
- Lists 2 modes: `"light"`, `"dark"`
- Documents storage key and persistence

**Why This Matters:**
The documentation previously showed props that didn't exist in the implementation (`defaultTheme`, `defaultMode`), which would cause confusion and errors for users. Now the documentation accurately reflects the actual API and provides clear guidance on how to achieve the intended behavior programmatically.

**Technical Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines 1141-1201)
  - Updated Step 4: Add Theme Provider section
  - Corrected code example
  - Added comprehensive props table with 4 subsections
  - Total addition: ~60 lines of documentation

## 2026-01-26T20:30:00Z

### 📊 Documentation Audit Phase 0 Complete - Issues #2 and #3 RESOLVED

**Issue #2: Fixed Component Count Discrepancy** ✅

Updated all documentation from inaccurate "48 components" to correct "89 components" count.

**What Changed:**
- Created `packages/ui/src/component-registry.ts` as source of truth for component metadata
  - Documents all 89 components across 7 core categories + specialty components
  - Provides marketing copy, documentation templates, and decision rationale
  - Exported from main `@thesage/ui` package for programmatic access
- Updated documentation in:
  - `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/OverviewTab.tsx` (48 → 89)
  - `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/UsageTab.tsx` (48 → 89)
  - `packages/sds-mcp-server/src/registry.ts` (header comment)
  - `packages/sds-mcp-server/README.md` (3 references updated)

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Core Categories (84 components):**
  - Actions: 5
  - Forms: 18
  - Navigation: 10
  - Overlays: 11
  - Feedback: 7
  - Data Display: 16
  - Layout: 17
- **Specialty (5 components):**
  - Backgrounds: 2
  - Cursor: 2
  - Blocks: 1

**Decision Made:** Count ALL exports from `@thesage/ui` as official components, following industry standards (Material UI, Radix, Chakra). No artificial "specialty" tier—if it's exported, it's official.

---

**Issue #3: Added Prerequisites & Peer Dependencies Documentation** ✅

Addressed critical gap where Getting Started jumped directly to installation without documenting requirements.

**What Was Added:**
- **Prerequisites Card** in `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`:
  - System requirements (Node.js 18+, React 18+, Tailwind 3+)
  - Compatible frameworks (Next.js, Vite, Remix, CRA)
  - TypeScript support (optional, 5.0+)
- **Updated Step 1 (Install Dependencies):**
  - Now explicitly includes peer dependencies: `pnpm add react framer-motion @thesage/ui`
  - Explains that React and Framer Motion are required
- **New Step 2 (Configure Tailwind CSS):**
  - Complete `tailwind.config.ts` example
  - Shows how to add `@thesage/ui` to content paths
  - Notes that themes use CSS variables (no Tailwind config needed)
- **Renumbered Steps:**
  - Step 3: Import and use components (was Step 2)
  - Step 4: Wrap with ThemeProvider (was Step 3)
  - Step 5: Use Hooks (was Step 4)

**Impact:**
- Users can now successfully set up Sage UI from scratch without prior knowledge
- Installation instructions are complete and accurate
- Peer dependencies are explicitly documented (prevents runtime errors)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`

---

**Phase 0 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (3/3 issues resolved)

### Documentation Audit - Sage UI ✅

**Comprehensive Zero-Context Usability Audit**

Conducted a rigorous CTO-level audit of the Getting Started and MCP Server documentation sections to ensure external developers and LLMs can successfully use Sage UI with no prior knowledge.

**Audit Findings:**

**CRITICAL BLOCKERS (P0):**
1. **Packages Not Published** - `@thesage/ui` and `@thesage/mcp` return 404 from npm, making installation instructions impossible to follow
2. **Component Count Inaccurate** - Documentation claims "48 components" but reality is 60+ exported, 36 in MCP registry
3. **Missing Prerequisites** - No documentation of required Node.js version, peer dependencies (react, framer-motion), or Tailwind configuration

**HIGH-SEVERITY ISSUES (P1):**
- ThemeProvider props not documented
- Motion system (0-10 scale) not explained
- MCP install command won't work (package not published)

**MODERATE ISSUES (P2):**
- Component-first architecture callout appears before users have context
- Tailwind configuration guide missing entirely
- No troubleshooting section in Getting Started

**MINOR ISSUES (P3):**
- Inconsistent internal link patterns (#quick-start vs #overview/quick-start)
- "Usage Guide" filename mismatch
- 40+ components missing from MCP registry

**CONTENT GAPS:**
- No "What's Next?" section after setup
- System requirements not listed
- MCP local development setup missing
- CLI commands not documented

**Implementation Plan:**

Created comprehensive 4-phase implementation plan:
- **Phase 0: Critical Blockers** (1-2 days) - Fix package publication issue, accurate counts, prerequisites
- **Phase 1: Pre-External Review** (2-3 days) - Document ThemeProvider, motion system, fix MCP
- **Phase 2: Important Improvements** (3-5 days) - Tailwind config, troubleshooting, content gaps
- **Phase 3: Polish** (2-3 days) - Consistency, MCP completeness, CLI reference

**Deliverables:**

1. **Audit Document:** `apps/web/docs/SAGE-UI-AUDIT.md`
   - Complete issue descriptions with file paths and line numbers
   - Evidence from actual codebase
   - Concrete solutions for each issue
   - Phased implementation checklist
   - Resume prompt for LLMs to continue work
   - Success metrics and completion criteria

2. **External Links Verified:** All GitHub and documentation links tested (6/6 passing)

3. **Component Inventory:** Actual counts per category:
   - Actions: 5 (claimed 3)
   - Forms: 18 (claimed 11)
   - Navigation: 10 (claimed 6)
   - Overlays: 11 (claimed 9)
   - Feedback: 6 (claimed 5)
   - Data Display: 16 (claimed 6)
   - Layout: 15 (claimed 8)
   - **Plus:** backgrounds (2), blocks (multiple), cursor (2), motion (multiple)
   - **Total:** 85+ components in codebase, 90+ exported, only 36 in MCP registry

**Key Insight:**

The documentation is well-written and thoughtfully structured, but currently describes a system that cannot be installed by following its own instructions. This must be fixed before external technical reviews.

**Recommendation:** DO NOT show documentation to Teg or external reviewers until Phase 0 (Critical Blockers) is complete.

**Files Changed:**
- Added: `apps/web/docs/SAGE-UI-AUDIT.md` (comprehensive audit with implementation plan)
- Updated: `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry)

**Next Steps:**
1. Decide: Publish packages to npm OR rewrite docs for monorepo-only setup
2. Implement Phase 0 fixes (critical blockers)
3. Update all component count references
4. Add prerequisites and peer dependency documentation

### Typography System - Phase 7 Complete ✅ 🎉

**Typography Playground Implementation**

Completed Phase 7 with a professional-grade Typography Playground - a full-page customizer for creating and fine-tuning complete type scales with granular control over all 8 type levels.

#### Enhanced Data Model

**Extended fontThemes.ts** (`packages/tokens/src/fontThemes.ts`):
- **TypeLevel interface** - Detailed properties for a single type level:
  - `fontFamily` - Font family name (e.g., "Inter")
  - `weight` - Font weight (300-800)
  - `size` - Font size in pixels
  - `lineHeight` - Line height as unitless number
  - `letterSpacing` - Letter spacing in em units
- **TypographyScale interface** - Complete type scale with 8 levels:
  - Display, H1, H2, H3, H4, Body, Small, Code
- **Extended FontTheme** - Added optional `scale?: TypographyScale` property
- **generateScale() helper** - Generates detailed scales from simple FontTheme objects using modular scale (1.25 ratio)

#### Typography Playground Component

**Created: `TypographyPlayground.tsx`** (~700 lines)
Location: `apps/web/app/components/studio/pages/typography/TypographyPlayground.tsx`

**Layout:**
- Sidebar (left) - Preset selector + Collapsible accordions for each type level

#### Changes Made

**Updated `OpenGraphCardPage.tsx`:**
- Expanded `AVAILABLE_FONTS` list from 15 to 29 fonts
- Added all fonts from Typography System:
  - Abril Fatface, Fredoka, IBM Plex Mono, IBM Plex Sans, Karla, Lato, Libre Bodoni, Merriweather, Montserrat, Nunito, Nunito Sans, Poppins, Work Sans
- Fixed deprecated font: "Source Sans Pro" → "Source Sans 3"
- Fonts sorted alphabetically for better UX

**Verified Existing Functionality:**
- ✅ `SavedOGDesign` interface already includes `fontFamily: string` (line 35)
- ✅ Font selector UI already implemented with Select component (lines 361-376)
- ✅ Font family state management working (`useState`, save/load, delete)
- ✅ Edge Config sync includes fontFamily in payload (line 170)

### Typography System - Phase 3 Complete ✅

**Dynamic Font Loading System**

Implemented a comprehensive font loading system that manages 30+ Google Fonts for the typography theme system. While Next.js loads fonts statically at build time, this system provides dynamic application of fonts via CSS variables and tracking of font loading state.

#### New Files Created

**`lib/fonts-dynamic.ts`** - Font loading utilities
- Font registry with 21 Google Fonts pre-configured
- `getFontConfig(fontName)` - Get font configuration by name
- `getFontVariable(fontName)` - Get CSS variable for a font
- `getFontThemeVariables(fontTheme)` - Get all CSS variables for a theme
- `getFontThemeFamilies(fontTheme)` - Get all font families in a theme
- `isSystemFont(fontName)` - Check if font is a system font
- `getAllFontNames()` - Get all registered font names
- `markFontsAsLoaded(fontNames)` - Track loading status
- `areFontsLoaded(fontNames)` - Check if fonts are loaded
- `GOOGLE_FONTS_PRECONNECT` - Preconnect URLs for optimization

**`hooks/useFontThemeLoader.ts`** - React hook for font theme management
- `useFontThemeLoader(fontTheme, options)` - Main hook
- Returns: `status`, `isLoading`, `isLoaded`, `error`, `applyFontTheme()`, `resetFonts()`
- Automatically applies fonts via CSS variables to target element
- Tracks loading status: idle → loading → loaded/error
- Callbacks: `onLoaded`, `onError`
- `usePreloadFontTheme(fontTheme)` - Preload fonts without applying

**Updated `lib/fonts.ts`** - Extended font registry
- Added 21 new Google Font imports
- Total: 30+ fonts loaded
- All fonts configured with proper weights and display: swap
- System fonts (System UI, SF Mono) handled separately

#### Fonts Loaded

**New Fonts Added:**
- Inter, Roboto, Roboto Mono
- Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat
- Source Sans 3 (replaces Source Sans Pro)
- Raleway, Poppins, Work Sans
- Playfair Display, Merriweather
- Quicksand, Karla
- Cormorant Garamond, Libre Bodoni
- Abril Fatface, Fredoka
- JetBrains Mono
- IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Mono

**System Fonts (no loading required):**
- System UI
- SF Mono

#### Key Features

✅ **Static Loading** - All fonts loaded at build time via next/font/google
✅ **Dynamic Application** - Fonts applied via CSS variables at runtime
✅ **Loading Status** - Track and react to font loading state
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks if fonts fail to load
✅ **System Font Support** - Special handling for system fonts
✅ **Performance** - Font display: swap for optimal loading
✅ **Preconnect** - URLs provided for HTML head optimization

#### Usage Example

```typescript
import { useFontThemeLoader } from '@/hooks/useFontThemeLoader'
import { fontThemes } from '@thesage/tokens'

function FontThemePreview() {
  const voltTheme = fontThemes.find(ft => ft.id === 'volt')
  const { status, isLoaded, applyFontTheme, resetFonts } = useFontThemeLoader(voltTheme, {
    autoApply: true,
    targetSelector: '#preview',
    onLoaded: () => console.log('Fonts ready!'),
    onError: (err) => console.error(err),
  })

  return (
    <div id="preview">
      {status === 'loading' && <p>Loading fonts...</p>}
      {isLoaded && <p>Fonts loaded! Heading: Space Grotesk</p>}
      <button onClick={applyFontTheme}>Apply</button>
      <button onClick={resetFonts}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Technical Details

**Font Loading Strategy:**
- Next.js `next/font/google` loads fonts statically at build time
- Fonts are optimized and self-hosted automatically
- This system manages *application* of fonts via CSS variables
- CSS variables allow runtime switching without reloading fonts

**CSS Variables Applied:**
- `--font-heading` - Heading font family
- `--font-body` - Body font family
- `--font-mono` - Monospace font family
- `--font-heading-weight` - Heading font weight
- `--font-body-weight` - Body font weight
- `--font-heading-letter-spacing` - Heading letter spacing
- `--font-body-letter-spacing` - Body letter spacing
- `--font-heading-line-height` - Heading line height
- `--font-body-line-height` - Body line height

**Verification:**
- ✅ All 30+ fonts loading correctly
- ✅ web builds successfully
- ✅ Font registry complete
- ✅ Hooks working correctly
- ✅ CSS variables applying properly
- ✅ System fonts handled correctly

**Next Steps (Phases 4-6):**
- Phase 4: Build Typography showcase page UI
- Phase 5: Integrate with OG Card customizer
- Phase 6: Documentation and polish

---

### Typography System - Phase 2 Complete ✅

**State Management: Zustand Store Integration**

Extended the existing Zustand customizer store to manage font theme state with full localStorage persistence. This enables users to apply curated font themes, create custom themes, and persist their preferences across sessions.

#### Store Extensions

**New State Properties:**
- `customFontThemes: { [theme]: { [mode]: FontTheme } }` - Applied font themes per theme/mode
- `savedFontThemes: SavedFontTheme[]` - User-created custom font themes

**New Interface:**
- `SavedFontTheme` - Extends `FontTheme` with id, createdAt, and 'custom' category

**Font Theme Actions:**
- `applyFontTheme(theme, mode, fontTheme)` - Apply a font theme to specific theme/mode
- `resetCustomFonts(theme, mode?)` - Reset fonts to defaults
- `getActiveFontTheme(theme, mode)` - Get currently active font theme

**Saved Font Theme Actions:**
- `saveFontTheme(fontTheme)` - Save a custom font theme with unique ID
- `updateFontTheme(id, updates)` - Update existing saved theme
- `renameFontTheme(id, newName)` - Rename a saved theme
- `deleteFontTheme(id)` - Delete a saved theme
- `reorderFontThemes(fontThemes)` - Reorder saved themes
- `getSavedFontThemes()` - Get all saved themes

**Persistence:**
- Updated persist middleware version to 4 (from 3)
- Added `customFontThemes` and `savedFontThemes` to partialize
- Full localStorage persistence for all font theme state
- Survives page reloads and browser sessions

**Verification:**
- ✅ All actions working correctly (tested in Node.js)
- ✅ Type definitions generated correctly
- ✅ Follows same pattern as color palette management
- ✅ Package builds successfully
- ✅ State updates and resets working

**Testing Results:**
```
✅ Apply font theme - working
✅ Save custom font theme - working
✅ Get active font theme - working
✅ Reset custom fonts - working
✅ Saved themes persisted with unique IDs
```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { useCustomizer } from '@thesage/ui'
import { fontThemes } from '@thesage/tokens'

const { applyFontTheme, getActiveFontTheme, saveFontTheme } = useCustomizer()

// Apply a curated theme
const voltTheme = fontThemes.find(ft => ft.id === 'volt')
applyFontTheme('studio', 'dark', voltTheme)

// Get active theme
const active = getActiveFontTheme('studio', 'dark')

// Save a custom theme
saveFontTheme({
  name: 'My Brand',
  description: 'Custom brand fonts',
  heading: 'Poppins',
  body: 'Inter',
  mono: 'Fira Code',
  // ... other properties
})
```

**Next Steps (Phases 3-6):**
- Phase 3: Implement dynamic font loading system
- Phase 4: Build Typography showcase page UI
- Phase 5: Integrate with OG Card customizer
- Phase 6: Documentation and polish

## 2026-01-14

### Phase 4: Legacy Migration Started (~25-30% Complete)

**Major Architectural Decision:**
- Skipped formal deprecation phase (Phase 4 originally planned)
- Going directly to migration since all usage is internal (3 apps only)
- No external consumers to notify or provide migration guides for

#### Infrastructure Setup in @thesage/ui ✅

**Utilities:**
- Added `lib/syntax-parser/` - Complete tokenizer system for code syntax highlighting
  - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions (SyntaxType, SyntaxToken, Language)
  - `patterns.ts` - Regex patterns for JS/TS/JSX/TSX tokenization
  - `tokenizer.ts` - Core tokenization logic
  - `index.ts` - Public API with `parseCode()` function
- Added `lib/store/` - Zustand stores for state management
  - `theme.ts` - Theme state and persistence
  - `customizer.ts` - Customizer panel state
- Added `lib/validation.ts` - Form validation utilities

**Providers:**
- Added `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Theme management and context

**Hooks:**
- Added `hooks/useTheme.ts` - Theme access and manipulation
- Added `hooks/useMotionPreference.ts` - Motion preference management
- Added `hooks/useForm.ts` - Form state and validation

#### Components Migrated to Functional Categories ✅

Migrated 15+ critical components from `@ecosystem/design-system` to `@thesage/ui`:

- **Actions:** Link
- **Forms:** ThemeSwitcher, ThemeToggle
- **Navigation:** NavLink
- **Data Display:** Code, CollapsibleCodeBlock, GitHubIcon, Heading, Text
- **Layout:** Header (with subdir), Footer (with subdir)
- **Feedback:** Toast (ToastProvider, useToast hook)

#### Critical Architecture Fix ✅

**Problem:** Initial migration accidentally created `components/molecules/` and `components/organisms/` directories, violating the functional organization principle.

**Solution:**
- Deleted `components/molecules/` and `components/organisms/` directories
- Reorganized all components into proper functional categories:
  - molecules/ThemeSwitcher → forms/ThemeSwitcher
  - molecules/ThemeToggle → forms/ThemeToggle
  - organisms/CollapsibleCodeBlock → data-display/CollapsibleCodeBlock
  - organisms/Toast → feedback/Toast
  - organisms/Header → layout/Header
  - organisms/Footer → layout/Footer

**Updated all exports:**
- Updated category index.ts files (actions, forms, navigation, data-display, layout, feedback)
- Updated main `/packages/ui/src/index.ts` to export all new components
- Removed all references to molecules/ and organisms/ directories

#### MCP Server Integration ✅

**Claude Desktop Configuration:**
- Added @thesage/mcp to Claude Desktop config
- Configuration file: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Uses local path: `node /Users/shalomormsby/Developer/work/ecosystem/packages/sds-mcp-server/dist/index.js`
- Enables Claude Desktop to browse, search, and install all 48 Sage UI components via natural language

#### Documentation Updates ✅

**SAGE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_STRATEGY.md:**
- Added "Quick Start: Resuming Phase 4 Migration" section at top
- Updated Phase 4 from "Planned" to "In Progress" with detailed status
- Added complete list of remaining components to migrate (~40 remaining)
- Added file location reference tree showing migrated component structure
- Updated roadmap to reflect Phase 4 in progress
- Added decision log entries for migration start and MCP configuration
- Updated status header to show current phase and completion percentage

### Remaining Work (Phase 4 - ~70% to go)

1. **Copy ~40 remaining components** from design-system to @thesage/ui
2. **Build @thesage/ui package** and resolve TypeScript errors
3. **Migrate app imports:**
   - Portfolio (~10 files)
   - Creative Powerup (~3 files)
   - Sage Studio (~30+ files)
4. **Remove legacy package** and delete design-system directory
5. **Verify all apps build successfully**

## 2025-12-31

### Added - Automatic Syntax Parser & Documentation Enhancement

#### New Feature: Lightweight Syntax Parser for Code Highlighting
- **Built-in automatic code tokenization** for TypeScript/JavaScript/JSX syntax highlighting
- **Zero-configuration** - just pass plain code strings to `CollapsibleCodeBlock`
- **Lightweight implementation** - ~2KB regex-based parser with O(n) performance
- **14 token types**: comment, keyword, function, string, number, boolean, operator, property, className, tag, attribute, variable, punctuation, plain
- **Theme-aware colors** - syntax highlighting adapts to light/dark mode with WCAG AA contrast
- **No external dependencies** - completely self-contained within design system

#### Core Components
- **`parseCode()` utility** (`design-system/utils/syntax-parser/`) - Automatic tokenization function
  ```typescript
  import { parseCode } from '@ecosystem/design-system/utils'
  const tokens = parseCode(`const greeting = "Hello World";`)
  ```
- **`CollapsibleCodeBlock` organism** - Enhanced with automatic syntax highlighting when `code` prop is a string
- **`Code` atom** - Simple inline/block code display without syntax highlighting
- **14 syntax color tokens** - CSS variables for manual styling (e.g., `var(--syntax-keyword)`)

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Auto-parsing happens automatically in CollapsibleCodeBlock
const tokens = useMemo(() => {
  return typeof code === 'string' ? parseCode(code) : code;
}, [code]);

// Supports both automatic and manual tokenization
<CollapsibleCodeBlock
  code={`your code string`}  // Auto-tokenizes
/>
<CollapsibleCodeBlock
  code={manualTokens}  // Or pass pre-tokenized array
/>
```

### Fixed - Comprehensive Code Block Documentation Update

#### Problem
Code blocks throughout Sage Studio lacked multi-color syntax highlighting despite the parser being built. All code examples used `Code inline={false}` which only applies single-color styling.

#### Solution
**Systematically replaced 36 instances** of `Code inline={false}` with `CollapsibleCodeBlock` across 6 documentation files:

| File | Instances Fixed | Code Block IDs |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| `OverviewSection.tsx` | 2 | basic-usage, theme-switching |
| `CommonPatternsSection.tsx` | 8 | pattern-1 to pattern-8 |
| `HooksSection.tsx` | 7 | hook-1 to hook-7 |
| `AddingComponentsSection.tsx` | 12 | add-comp-1 to add-comp-12 |
| `ArchitectureSection.tsx` | 1 | arch-1 |
| `OrganismsSection.tsx` | 6 | org-usage-1 to org-usage-6 |

**Transformation pattern**:
```typescript
// Before (single-color)
<Code inline={false} syntax="plain">{`code here`}</Code>

// After (multi-color with auto-parsing)
<CollapsibleCodeBlock
  id="unique-id"
  code={`code here`}
  defaultCollapsed={false}
  showCopy={true}
/>
```

#### Documentation Additions
- **Design System README** - Added comprehensive "Syntax Highlighting & Code Display" section with:
  - Quick example and feature overview
  - 14 syntax token types with CSS variable names
  - Manual usage examples for `parseCode()` utility
  - Component comparison guide (when to use `Code` vs `CollapsibleCodeBlock`)

### Fixed - Styling System & Architecture

#### Critical Tailwind Configuration Fix
**Problem**: Tailwind wasn't processing any files - content paths pointed to non-existent `./src/` directories after restructure.

**Impact**: Zero styling applied - cards, grids, typography all broken.

**Solution**: Updated `tailwind.config.ts` content paths:
```typescript
content: [
  "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",       // Was: "./src/app/**/*"
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}", // Was: "./src/components/**/*"
  "./lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "../../design-system/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
]
```

Added proper color variable mapping:
```typescript
colors: {
  background: "var(--color-background)",
  "background-secondary": "var(--color-background-secondary)",
  foreground: "var(--color-foreground)",
  primary: "var(--color-primary)",
  accent: "var(--color-accent)",
}
```

#### CSS Variables System Completion
Added missing design system CSS variables to `globals.css`:
- **Color variables**: `--color-glass-border`, `--color-background-secondary`
- **Effect variables**: `--effect-blur-*`, `--effect-shadow-*`
- **Typography variables**: `--font-heading`, `--font-body`, `--font-mono`
- **Motion variables**: `--ease-default`, `--ease-spring`
- **Theme transition styles**: `.theme-transitioning` class for smooth theme changes

### Fixed - Centralized Font Architecture (Critical)

#### The Problem: Duplicate Font Configurations
**Initial approach** (WRONG):
- Each app defined its own font loading in `lib/fonts.ts`
- Font variable names were inconsistent across apps
- ThemeProvider expected specific variable names but apps used different ones
- Result: **Font switching in Customizer didn't work**

#### The Solution: Configuration vs Implementation Pattern
**Architectural principle**: Design-system defines WHAT, apps define HOW.

**Design-System Layer** (Configuration - Framework Agnostic):
- Created `design-system/fonts/index.ts` exporting font configurations:
  ```typescript
  export interface FontConfig {
    family: string;      // "Inter"
    variable: string;    // "--font-studio-heading"
    weight: string[];    // ["400", "500", "600", "700"]
    subsets?: string[];
    display?: string;
  }
  ```
- Defines canonical variable names ThemeProvider expects
- No framework dependencies (Next.js, etc.)
- Single source of truth for font specifications

**App Layer** (Implementation - Framework Specific):
- Apps load fonts with `next/font/google` using config specifications
- Both `creative-powerup` and `portfolio` use identical variable names
- Example:
  ```typescript
  export const studioHeading = Inter({
    variable: '--font-studio-heading',  // From design-system config
    weight: ['400', '500', '600', '700'],
  });
  ```

#### Why This Architecture Matters
**Before**:
- ❌ Duplication across apps
- ❌ Inconsistent variable names
- ❌ Font switching broken
- ❌ Design-system tied to Next.js

**After**:
- ✅ Single source of truth in design-system
- ✅ Consistent variable names guaranteed
- ✅ Font switching works automatically via ThemeProvider
- ✅ Framework-agnostic design-system (can support Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- ✅ Apps remain framework-specific (Next.js font optimization)

#### Implementation Details
1. **ThemeProvider** (`design-system/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`) sets font CSS variables dynamically:
   ```typescript
   '--font-heading': fonts?.heading || 'var(--font-studio-heading)',
   '--font-body': fonts?.body || 'var(--font-studio-body)',
   '--font-mono': fonts?.mono || 'var(--font-studio-mono)',
   ```

2. **Font maps** defined for each theme:
   - Studio: `--font-studio-heading`, `--font-studio-body`, `--font-studio-mono`
   - Sage: `--font-sage-sans`, `--font-sage-serif`, `--font-sage-mono`
   - Volt: `--font-volt-sans`, `--font-volt-mono`

3. **Apps load all fonts** upfront, ThemeProvider switches which ones are active

### Results
- ✅ Creative Sandbox builds successfully
- ✅ All styling applied correctly (Tailwind + CSS variables)
- ✅ Font switching works with theme changes
- ✅ Zero duplication in font configuration
- ✅ Design-system remains framework-agnostic
- ✅ Both portfolio and creative-powerup use identical font system

### Technical Debt Resolved
- Removed incorrect `design-system/fonts/nextjs.ts` (attempted to load Next.js fonts in library)
- Removed duplicate font configs with wrong variable names
- Fixed TypeScript path aliases in `tsconfig.json` (`"@/*": ["./*"]` instead of `"./src/*"`)
- Updated both apps to React 19 for consistency

## 2025-12-16T14:32:00Z

- Added AGENTS.md with comprehensive guidance for AI collaborators
- Updated DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md to elevate "Lovable by Design" as North Star and provide practical guidance for how to encode human-centered principles into every creative decision we make.

### Fixed - Comprehensive Theme System Audit & Completion (Latest)

#### Typography System Enhancement
- **Automatic heading font switching** - All h1-h6 elements now use `var(--font-heading)` automatically
- **Theme-specific typography attributes**:
  - **Studio**: Semi-bold headings (600), tight spacing (-0.02em), clean sans-serif
  - **Sage**: Semi-bold serif headings (Lora 600), relaxed spacing, elegant body text (Instrument Sans)
  - **Volt**: Bold headings (Space Grotesk 700), very tight spacing (-0.03em), geometric sans
- **Typography preview** in Customizer showing active fonts for each theme
- **Font loading references**:
  - Studio: Inter (placeholder for Geist) + JetBrains Mono
  - Sage: Instrument Sans (body) + Lora (headings) + JetBrains Mono (code)
  - Volt: Space Grotesk (both) + Fira Code (code)

#### Theme Token Completion
- **Sage theme fully implemented** with complete color palettes for both light and dark modes:
  - Light: Warm earthy tones (#faf8f5 background, #7a9b7f sage green, #c17a5f terracotta accent)
  - Dark: Deep forest backgrounds (#1a1614) with brighter sage greens and warm peachy accents
  - Complete effects (blur, shadow) and motion curves (slower, organic animations 300-840ms)
- **Volt theme fully implemented** with vibrant cyberpunk aesthetic:
  - Light: Electric blues (#0066ff), vibrant cyan (#00d9ff), sharp contrast
  - Dark: Pure black (#000000) with neon colors (#0099ff, #00ffff), glow shadows
  - Complete effects with glow-style shadows and fast, snappy animations (100-325ms)

#### Global Theme Application
- **Fixed Tailwind config** to use CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors
  - All `neutral.*` shades now use `color-mix()` to blend foreground/background dynamically
  - `background`, `foreground`, `primary`, `accent` all reference theme CSS variables
  - Font families reference theme-specific font variables
- **Fixed Experience Customizer** to be fully theme-aware:
  - Panel background uses glass effect with blur
  - All colors reference CSS variables (no more hardcoded `bg-white`, `text-black`)
  - Active states use `--color-primary` for consistency across themes
- **Fixed all portfolio pages** to remove hardcoded colors:
  - Home page: All `text-neutral-*`, `bg-neutral-*` → `text-foreground`, `bg-background`
  - About page: All `text-gray-*` → `text-foreground` with opacity
  - Not Found page: All colors converted to theme-aware classes

#### Visual Theme Differentiation
Now when switching themes, users see dramatically different experiences:
- **Studio**: Clean, professional grays and blues (like Vercel/Linear)
- **Sage**: Warm earth tones, muted greens, organic feel
- **Volt**: Electric blues, sharp contrast, cyberpunk neon (especially in dark mode)

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Light/Dark mode only applying to 3 cards → now applies **globally** to entire app
- Fixed Customizer panel not responding to theme changes
- Fixed "Built with Transparent Design" section colors
- Fixed hydration warnings with `suppressHydrationWarning` on html/body tags

### Added - Multi-Theme Design System Architecture (Initial Release)

#### Theme System Foundation
- **Multi-theme architecture** supporting 3 distinct design languages:
  - **Studio** (🏢): Professional, balanced aesthetic inspired by Framer, Vercel, Linear
  - **Sage** (🌿): Calm, organic, feminine/yin aesthetic (placeholder for Phase 2)
  - **Volt** (⚡): Bold, electric, masculine/yang aesthetic (placeholder for Phase 3)
- Each theme supports both **light** and **dark** modes (6 total combinations)
- Separation of concerns: primitives (headless components) vs themes (visual identities)

#### Token System
- **Base tokens** (`design-system/tokens/base.ts`):
  - Shared spacing scale (0-32, 4px increments)
  - Typography scales (fontSize, fontWeight, lineHeight)
  - Border radius values
  - Duration values for animations
  - Easing curves
  - Z-index scales
- **Theme-specific tokens**:
  - `design-system/tokens/studio.ts` - Complete implementation
  - `design-system/tokens/sage.ts` - Placeholder structure
  - `design-system/tokens/volt.ts` - Placeholder structure
- **Token categories** per theme:
  - Colors (background, foreground, primary, accent, semantic colors, glass effects)
  - Effects (blur levels, shadow scales)
  - Motion (intensity-based duration calculation, theme-specific easing)
  - Typography (font family references)

#### Theme Switching & State Management
- **Zustand store** (`design-system/store/theme.ts`):
  - Theme selection (studio/sage/volt)
  - Mode selection (light/dark)
  - LocalStorage persistence
  - Type-safe theme configuration
- **ThemeProvider** (`design-system/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`):
  - Converts theme tokens to CSS variables
  - Applies variables to `:root` element
  - Manages animated transitions (300ms fade)
  - Sets `data-theme` and `data-mode` attributes for conditional styling
  - Graceful fallbacks for incomplete theme definitions

#### Font Loading System
- **Theme-specific fonts** (`apps/portfolio/lib/fonts.ts`):
  - Studio: Inter (placeholder for Geist) + JetBrains Mono
  - Sage: Instrument Sans + Lora serif + JetBrains Mono
  - Volt: Space Grotesk + Fira Code
- **next/font optimization**: All fonts loaded upfront, swapped via CSS variables
- **Easy replacement**: Centralized font configuration for future updates

#### Component Integration
- **Button** (`design-system/atoms/Button/Button.tsx`):
  - Uses CSS variables for all colors
  - Variants: primary, secondary, ghost
  - Sizes: sm, md, lg
- **Card** (`design-system/atoms/Card/Card.tsx`):
  - Uses CSS variables for background, borders, shadows
  - Optional hover effects
  - Theme-aware styling
- **Motion components** (`design-system/atoms/Motion/index.tsx`):
  - FadeIn, StaggerContainer, StaggerItem
  - **Motion intensity integration**: Duration scales with customizer slider (0-10)
  - **Theme-specific motion**: Each theme has unique duration curves and easing
  - **Accessibility**: Intensity 0 = no animations

#### Experience Customizer UI
- **Updated CustomizerPanel** (`design-system/features/customizer/CustomizerPanel.tsx`):
  - Theme picker with emoji indicators (🏢 Studio, 🌿 Sage, ⚡ Volt)
  - Mode toggle (☀️ Light, 🌙 Dark)
  - Motion intensity slider (0-10)
- **Split stores**: Theme state separate from customizer state
- LocalStorage persistence for all settings

#### CSS Architecture
- **Global CSS variables** (`apps/portfolio/app/globals.css`):
  - Color variables (--color-background, --color-foreground, etc.)
  - Effect variables (--effect-blur-*, --effect-shadow-*)
  - Typography variables (--font-heading, --font-body, --font-mono)
  - Motion variables (--ease-default, --ease-spring)
- **Theme transition styles**:
  - `.theme-transitioning` class for smooth color/background transitions
  - 300ms transition duration with theme-specific easing

#### Motion System Features
- **Intensity-based durations**:
  - Studio: 150ms (intensity 1) → 490ms (intensity 10), linear scale
  - Sage: 300ms (intensity 1) → 840ms (intensity 10), slower, organic
  - Volt: 100ms (intensity 1) → 325ms (intensity 10), fast, snappy
- **Theme-specific easing**:
  - Studio: Smooth, professional curves
  - Sage: Organic, flowing curves
  - Volt: Bouncy, spring-loaded curves
- **Stagger timing**: Scales with motion intensity
- **Zero-motion mode**: Complete animation disable for accessibility

### Technical Details

#### Architecture Decisions
- **CSS variables over Tailwind JIT**: Enables runtime theme switching without recompilation
- **Zustand over Context**: Better performance, simpler API, built-in persistence
- **Token-driven design**: All visual properties defined in tokens, not in components
- **Graceful degradation**: Optional chaining ensures placeholder themes don't break
