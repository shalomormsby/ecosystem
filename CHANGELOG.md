### ✅ Standardized Breadcrumb Placement

**Fixed systemic inconsistency in breadcrumb hierarchy across documentation**

Audit revealed that breadcrumbs were inconsistently placed (sometimes below title, sometimes above) and handled redundantly by parent components. This update unifies the UX by ensuring breadcrumbs always appear at the very top of the content area.

**Key Changes:**

**1. Hierarchy Standardization**
- **Rule:** Breadcrumbs > Title > Description > Content.
- **Implementation:** Moved breadcrumb rendering block to the top of the header `div` in all section components.
- **Affected Sections:** `ArchitectureSection`, `AddingComponentsSection`, `CommonPatternsSection`, `ContributingSection`.

**2. Component Delegation**
- **Refactor:** Removed breadcrumb rendering from parent `GettingStartedSection`.
- **Logic:** Child components now strictly handle their own breadcrumbs, preventing duplication and state mismatches.
- **Benefit:** Cleaner prop drilling and reliable rendering regardless of routing depth.

**3. Verification:**
- ✅ Validated breadcrumb placement in all documentation sections.
- ✅ Confirmed `DocsPage` passes props correctly.
- ✅ Fixed specific duplication in `ToolsSection` / `ChartsSections`.

### ✅ Ecosystem-Wide Branding Update: Sage Design Engine & Terra Theme

**Strategic realignment of product identity and theme nomenclature**

Executed a comprehensive branding update to position the ecosystem as a "Design Engine" rather than just a UI library, and resolved naming collisions between the product and its default theme.

**Key Changes:**

**1. Product Rename: "Sage Design Engine"**
- Transitioned user-facing branding from "Sage UI" to "Sage Design Engine".
- **Tokenized Branding:** Refactored product name into a single "Source of Truth" design token (`BRAND.productName`) in `component-registry.ts`.
  - Implements "Change once, ripple everywhere" philosophy for brand identity.
  - Consumed by `OverviewSection`, `SageHero`, `page.tsx` (header), and `layout.tsx` (metadata).
- Updated Landing Page hero, window metadata, OpenGraph tags, and main Overview heading.
- **Why:** "UI Library" implies a static kit. "Design Engine" accurately reflects the architectural capabilities (Tokens → Primitives → Patterns → Archetypes) and AI-native nature of the system.
- **Note:** npm packages purposefully remain `@thesage/*` for stability and brand consistency.
- **Documentation:** Added new "Brand" tab to Design Tokens section, documenting the token and implementation philosophy.

**2. Theme Rename: "Terra" (formerly Sage)**
- Renamed the default organic theme from "Sage" to "Terra".
- Updated all code references: `sageTokens` → `terraTokens`, CSS variables `--font-sage-*` → `--font-terra-*`.
- Updated Customizer and Theme Switcher UIs.
- **Why:** Distinguishes the *content* (Terra: earthy, organic) from the *container* (Sage: the engine itself).

**3. Verification:**
- ✅ Validated full build (`pnpm build`).
- ✅ Verified Customizer theme switching works.
- ✅ Verified fonts load correctly with new variable names.
- ✅ Confirmed Landing Page and Documentation reflect new naming.

## 2026-01-27T22:00:00Z

### ✅ Completed Standardized Overview Pages & Templates

**Implemented "Change Once, Ripple Everywhere" architecture for documentation pages**

TRANSFORMATIVE UPDATE: Replaced ad-hoc overview pages with a standardized, template-driven architecture. This ensures every section of the documentation (Getting Started, Design Tokens, Themes, Tools, MCP, Templates) follows a coherent visual language and structure, while dramatically reducing maintenance overhead.

**What Was Built:**

**1. Reusable Layout Templates**
- **SectionOverview.tsx**: Smart template component that standardizes page layout:
  - Header with icon, dynamic badges, and title
  - Description text area
  - Grid navigation for child pages (automatically rendered as clickable cards)
  - Resources section support
- **SectionOverviewSimple.tsx**: Lightweight variant for informational content without complex navigation.

**2. Standardized Overview Pages**
Refactored all major section roots to use the new templates:
- **DesignTokensOverview.tsx**: 5 token categories (Colors, Typography, etc.)
- **ThemesOverview.tsx**: Theme features and capabilities
- **ToolsOverview.tsx**: Brand Builder, Open Graph Card, Charts
- **TemplatesOverview.tsx**: Swiss Grid principles and page templates
- **McpOverview.tsx**: Rich content with Features, Documentation, and Resources
- **GettingStartedOverview.tsx**: 5-step documentation journey

**3. Application Architecture Updates**
- **Navigation Tree**: 
  - Added `section` attributes to all top-level items for active state tracking
  - Cleaned up routing (removed redundant "Overview" children)
  - Moved "Brand Builder" from Templates → Tools
- **Routing**:
  - Updated `page.tsx` to handle new Getting Started routing
  - Configured route mapping for all new overview components

**4. Design System Consumption (Dog-fooding)**
- All new pages use 100% Sage UI components (`Heading`, `Text`, `Card`, `Badge`)
- Strict adherence to design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Removed all hardcoded styles in favor of system utilities

**Why This Matters:**
This update validates the "Sage UI" strategic value proposition. By using a single `SectionOverview` template, we have:
1. **Unified the User Experience**: Every section feels part of the same family.
2. **Simplified Maintenance**: Updating the `SectionOverview` design instantly updates 6+ major pages.
3. **Improved Navigation**: Consistent grid layouts make exploring sub-sections intuitive.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Static pages generated (8/8)
- ✅ Routing verified for all sections
- ✅ Responsive design tested

### ✅ Completed Phase 2 - Important Improvements

**Four critical documentation improvements to enhance user experience and reduce setup friction**

Successfully completed Phase 2 of the documentation audit (4 out of 5 issues - Issue #8 was already 90% complete from Phase 0.3), focusing on pedagogical clarity, troubleshooting support, user journey guidance, and local development enablement.

**What Was Completed:**

**1. Issue #7: Component-First Callout Context Enhancement**
- **Problem:** Callout appeared early in Philosophy section without sufficient context, felt preachy
- **Solution:** Enhanced with "WHY this matters" explanation and specific benefits list:
  - ✅ Ensures consistency - Impossible to use wrong token combinations
  - ✅ Simplifies API - `<Text>` instead of `text-[var(--color-text-primary)]`
  - ✅ Enables smart defaults - Components choose appropriate tokens automatically
  - ✅ Improves DX - TypeScript autocomplete for semantic props
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines ~363-406)
- **Impact:** Users now understand the architectural rationale before seeing prescriptive do/don't examples

**2. Issue #9: Comprehensive Troubleshooting Section**
- **Problem:** Troubleshooting section was a stub with only external link, no inline help
- **Solution:** Expanded with 4 common issues, each with symptoms/causes/solutions:
  1. **Components are Unstyled** - Tailwind config, ThemeProvider, CSS loading
  2. **Motion/Animations Not Working** - ThemeProvider, motion preference, system settings
  3. **TypeScript Errors on Import** - Package installation, build process, import paths
  4. **Peer Dependency Warnings** - Missing React and Framer Motion
- Added "Still Having Issues?" section with links to Usage Guide, GitHub Issues, and Discussions
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines ~1533-1640)
- **Impact:** Zero-context users can self-diagnose and fix common setup issues without external support

**3. Gap #1: Next Steps Section After Setup**
- **Problem:** Documentation ended after Step 5 with no guidance on what to do next
- **Solution:** Added comprehensive "Next Steps" section with 4 action items:
  1. **Explore Components** - Links to all 7 functional categories
  2. **Try the Customizer** - Code example with `<CustomizerPanel />`
  3. **Read the Usage Guide** - Architecture and best practices
  4. **Build Something!** - Simple dashboard example code
- Added "Need Help?" footer with links to documentation, issues, discussions
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (after Step 5, before Documentation & Resources section)
- **Impact:** Clear user journey from setup to first real component, reduces drop-off after installation

**4. Gap #3: MCP Local Development Setup**
- **Problem:** MCP docs only covered published package, no local development workflow for contributors
- **Solution:** Added complete "Local Development Setup" section with 6 steps:
  1. Clone the Repository
  2. Install Dependencies
  3. Build the MCP Server
  4. Configure Your Client (Claude Desktop and Cursor configs with absolute paths)
  5. Restart Your Client (specific instructions per client)
  6. Verify Connection (test query)
- Added "Making Changes" section with rebuild workflow and watch mode
- **Location:** `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/InstallationTab.tsx` (new section at end)
- **Impact:** Contributors can now test MCP changes locally, enabling community contributions

**Note on Issue #8 (Tailwind Configuration):**
Issue #8 from Phase 2 spec was already 90% complete from Phase 0.3 work:
- Prerequisites section with system requirements ✅
- Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS with complete config example ✅
- Content paths documented ✅
- CSS variables automatic injection noted ✅
- Only missing piece: Optional "Custom Tailwind Integration" section (low priority)

**Why This Matters:**

Phase 2 addresses critical gaps in the user journey:
- **Pedagogical:** Component-First Callout now educates rather than prescribes
- **Self-Service Support:** Inline troubleshooting reduces support burden and friction
- **User Journey:** Next Steps bridges the gap between setup and building real features
- **Contributor Enablement:** Local dev setup opens MCP server to community contributions

These improvements move Sage UI documentation from "technically accurate" (Phase 0/1) to "genuinely helpful" (Phase 2), reducing time-to-first-success and enabling user autonomy.

**Technical Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
1. `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`
   - Enhanced Component-First Architecture callout with benefits list
   - Expanded Troubleshooting section with 4 inline common issues
   - Added Next Steps section with 4 action items and code examples

2. `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/InstallationTab.tsx`
   - Added complete Local Development Setup section
   - 6-step workflow with code examples for each step
   - Client-specific config examples (Claude Desktop, Cursor)
   - Development workflow guidance (rebuild + watch mode)

**Documentation Coverage:**
- Total additions: ~250 lines of documentation across 2 files
- Code examples added: 6 (Customizer, Build example, Local clone/build, Config examples)
- Common issues documented: 4 with symptoms/causes/solutions
- Next steps provided: 4 actionable pathways

**Verification:**
- Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- All code examples use correct import paths
- All internal links point to valid sections
- Troubleshooting solutions tested and verified

**Phase 2 Status:** ✅ **100% Complete** (4/4 remaining issues resolved, Issue #8 already done)

### ✅ Completed Phase 1.6 - Motion System Full Documentation

**Comprehensive explanation of the 0-10 motion scale system with accessibility features and usage guidance**

Successfully completed Phase 1.6 of the documentation audit, adding detailed documentation of the motion system that was previously only shown via code example without explanation.

**What Was Added:**

**1. Understanding the Motion System Section**
- Clear explanation of the 0-10 motion scale concept
- Emphasis on user control and fine-grained customization
- Accessibility-first messaging

**2. Motion Scale Table**
- Comprehensive 5-row table documenting all scale ranges:
  - **Scale 0**: No animations (instant state changes) - For vestibular disorders, motion sensitivity
  - **Scale 1-3**: Subtle animations (~100-200ms) - For minimal, professional interfaces
  - **Scale 5**: Balanced animations (default) - For general purpose, most users
  - **Scale 7-9**: Expressive animations - For engaging, playful interfaces
  - **Scale 10**: Maximum animation intensity - For highly interactive, game-like experiences
- Each row shows: scale value, behavior, and use case
- Clean, accessible table format matching ThemeProvider props table

**3. Automatic Accessibility Callout**
- Green-tinted success box with checkmark icon
- Key accessibility features:
  - Automatic respect for `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
  - `shouldAnimate` returns `false` when scale is 0 OR system preference is reduce
  - Motion scale 0 must work perfectly (no broken layouts or missing UI states)
  - No additional code needed - the hook handles everything
- Emphasizes accessibility as built-in, not opt-in

**4. How Users Set Motion Preferences Section**
- Three documented methods with priority ordering:

  **Method 1: The Customizer Component (Recommended)**
  - Code example showing `<CustomizerPanel />` integration
  - Described as floating panel with motion slider
  - Easiest method for end users
  - Collapsible code block for cleaner presentation

  **Method 2: Programmatically via Hook**
  - Code example showing custom range input implementation
  - Uses `setMotionPreference()` from `useMotionPreference()` hook
  - For developers who want custom UI
  - Collapsible code block

  **Method 3: System Preference (Automatic)**
  - Explains OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion` support
  - Notes that system setting overrides scale value
  - Happens automatically with no user action needed

**5. Persistence Note**
- Documents localStorage persistence
- Preferences sync across browser sessions
- Stored in customizer state

**6. Implementation Status Caveat (Added)**
- Yellow warning box about current implementation status
- Notes that API is complete but only subset of components use it
- Sets correct expectations for users and developers
- Aligns with "Transparent by Design" philosophy
- Honest about ongoing integration work

**Why This Matters:**
The motion system is a critical differentiator for Sage UI - it's not just "respect prefers-reduced-motion," it's a full 0-10 scale that gives users granular control. This documentation explains the philosophy and practical implementation, making it clear that accessibility is built-in from the start. The transparent note about partial implementation sets honest expectations while guiding developers toward best practices.

**Technical Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines 1284-1447)
  - Added ~163 lines of comprehensive documentation
  - Added to Step 5: Control themes and motion
  - Positioned after `useMotionPreference()` code example
  - Includes motion scale table, accessibility callout, and 3 usage methods
  - 2 collapsible code blocks for detailed examples

### ✅ Completed Phase 1.5 - ThemeProvider Props Documentation

**Comprehensive documentation of ThemeProvider API with accurate prop table and usage guidance**

Successfully completed Phase 1.5 of the documentation audit, correcting inaccurate code examples and adding complete documentation for the ThemeProvider component.

**What Was Fixed:**

**1. Corrected Code Example**
- Removed non-existent props from example (`defaultTheme`, `defaultMode`)
- Updated to show accurate minimal usage: `<ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>`
- Example now matches actual implementation in `packages/ui/src/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`

**2. Added Props Table**
- Comprehensive table documenting the single required prop: `children`
- Clean, accessible table format with columns: Prop, Type, Required, Description
- Uses design system components (Code, Badge) for consistency

**3. Added "Default Theme & Mode" Section**
- Documents actual defaults from theme store: `theme: "volt"`, `mode: "dark"`
- Explains localStorage persistence behavior
- Key: `"ecosystem-theme"`

**4. Added "Programmatic Control" Section**
- Shows how to use `useTheme()` hook to set initial theme/mode
- Complete code example with `useEffect` pattern for setting on mount
- Collapsible code block for better UX

**5. Added "Available Options" Section**
- Lists all 3 themes: `"studio"`, `"sage"`, `"volt"`
- Lists 2 modes: `"light"`, `"dark"`
- Documents storage key and persistence

**Why This Matters:**
The documentation previously showed props that didn't exist in the implementation (`defaultTheme`, `defaultMode`), which would cause confusion and errors for users. Now the documentation accurately reflects the actual API and provides clear guidance on how to achieve the intended behavior programmatically.

**Technical Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx` (lines 1141-1201)
  - Updated Step 4: Add Theme Provider section
  - Corrected code example
  - Added comprehensive props table with 4 subsections
  - Total addition: ~60 lines of documentation

### ✅ Fixed Blank Component Category Pages (Phase 1.4.1)

**Resolved Critical UX Bug** - Category navigation now fully functional

Successfully resolved Phase 1.4.1 of the Sage UI Documentation Audit. Category links from the Component Overview Dashboard (#actions, #forms, etc.) were leading to blank pages, breaking the navigation experience. This has been fixed.

**What Was Built:**
- Created `CategoryOverview` component for category landing pages
- Component displays:
  - Category name with emoji icon
  - Component count badge from COMPONENT_REGISTRY
  - Category description
  - Grid of all components in the category (clickable cards)
  - "When to Use" guidance section with category-specific advice
- All 7 category pages now populated with content
- Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)
- Click-through navigation to individual component pages

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created: `apps/web/app/components/studio/ComponentsSection/CategoryOverview.tsx`
- Updated: `apps/web/app/components/studio/ComponentsSection/index.tsx`
  - Added CategoryOverview import
  - Conditional rendering: CategoryOverview when no component selected, EnhancedComponentPlayground when component selected
- Data source: `COMPONENT_REGISTRY` from `@thesage/ui` for accuracy
- Navigation: Click component card → calls `onComponentSelect` → converts to kebab-case → updates URL hash

**Category-Specific Guidance:**
Each category landing page includes contextual "When to Use" guidance:
- Actions: Trigger operations, submit data, initiate state changes
- Forms: Collect user input with validation and accessibility
- Navigation: Help users move through application structure
- Overlays: Display contextual information without leaving page
- Feedback: Communicate system status and validation results
- Data Display: Present information in structured, scannable formats
- Layout: Provide structure and spacing for consistent UI

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Clicking any category card navigates to populated page
- ✅ All 7 category pages have complete content
- ✅ No blank pages anywhere in navigation flow
- ✅ Breadcrumbs show current location (existing functionality)
- ✅ Back navigation works intuitively (hash-based routing)
- ✅ Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ Responsive design verified

**Files Created:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/ComponentsSection/CategoryOverview.tsx` (198 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/ComponentsSection/index.tsx`
  - Added CategoryOverview import
  - Updated rendering logic to show CategoryOverview when no specific component selected
- `apps/web/docs/DOCUMENTATION-AUDIT.md`
  - Marked Phase 1.4.1 as complete
  - Updated progress metrics (18% → 23%)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 1.4.2: Move Components Dashboard to dedicated page
- Phase 1.4.3: Redesign as functional dashboard (accordion-style)
- Phase 1.4.4: Document maintenance process

## 2026-01-26T20:30:00Z

### 📊 Documentation Audit Phase 0 Complete - Issues #2 and #3 RESOLVED

**Issue #2: Fixed Component Count Discrepancy** ✅

Updated all documentation from inaccurate "48 components" to correct "89 components" count.

**What Changed:**
- Created `packages/ui/src/component-registry.ts` as source of truth for component metadata
  - Documents all 89 components across 7 core categories + specialty components
  - Provides marketing copy, documentation templates, and decision rationale
  - Exported from main `@thesage/ui` package for programmatic access
- Updated documentation in:
  - `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/OverviewTab.tsx` (48 → 89)
  - `apps/web/app/components/studio/McpSection/UsageTab.tsx` (48 → 89)
  - `packages/sds-mcp-server/src/registry.ts` (header comment)
  - `packages/sds-mcp-server/README.md` (3 references updated)

**Component Breakdown:**
- **Core Categories (84 components):**
  - Actions: 5
  - Forms: 18
  - Navigation: 10
  - Overlays: 11
  - Feedback: 7
  - Data Display: 16
  - Layout: 17
- **Specialty (5 components):**
  - Backgrounds: 2
  - Cursor: 2
  - Blocks: 1

**Decision Made:** Count ALL exports from `@thesage/ui` as official components, following industry standards (Material UI, Radix, Chakra). No artificial "specialty" tier—if it's exported, it's official.

---

**Issue #3: Added Prerequisites & Peer Dependencies Documentation** ✅

Addressed critical gap where Getting Started jumped directly to installation without documenting requirements.

**What Was Added:**
- **Prerequisites Card** in `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`:
  - System requirements (Node.js 18+, React 18+, Tailwind 3+)
  - Compatible frameworks (Next.js, Vite, Remix, CRA)
  - TypeScript support (optional, 5.0+)
- **Updated Step 1 (Install Dependencies):**
  - Now explicitly includes peer dependencies: `pnpm add react framer-motion @thesage/ui`
  - Explains that React and Framer Motion are required
- **New Step 2 (Configure Tailwind CSS):**
  - Complete `tailwind.config.ts` example
  - Shows how to add `@thesage/ui` to content paths
  - Notes that themes use CSS variables (no Tailwind config needed)
- **Renumbered Steps:**
  - Step 3: Import and use components (was Step 2)
  - Step 4: Wrap with ThemeProvider (was Step 3)
  - Step 5: Use Hooks (was Step 4)

**Impact:**
- Users can now successfully set up Sage UI from scratch without prior knowledge
- Installation instructions are complete and accurate
- Peer dependencies are explicitly documented (prevents runtime errors)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/app/components/studio/OverviewSection.tsx`

---

**Phase 0 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (3/3 issues resolved)

Next: Begin Phase 1 - Pre-External Review (Issues #4-6)

- ✅ MCP server now works: `npx @thesage/mcp`
- ✅ Zero-context developers can follow Getting Started guide
- ✅ Documentation no longer has 404 errors on first step

**Audit Progress:**
- Phase 0 (Critical Blockers): 33% complete (1/3 issues resolved)
- Overall: 6% complete (1/16 total issues resolved)

**Next Steps:**
- Test installation from npm (waiting for CDN propagation)
- Fix component count discrepancy (Issue #2)
- Add prerequisites documentation (Issue #3)

**Documentation Improvements:**
- **Consolidated 7 fragmented audit files → 1 document:** `DOCUMENTATION-AUDIT.md`
- Archived original files to `docs/archive/audit-2026-01-26/` for historical reference
- Current status, progress, decisions, and all issue details now in single place
- Added "Documentation Maintenance Protocol" requiring docs updates after every major task

### Documentation Audit - Sage UI ✅

**Comprehensive Zero-Context Usability Audit**

Conducted a rigorous CTO-level audit of the Getting Started and MCP Server documentation sections to ensure external developers and LLMs can successfully use Sage UI with no prior knowledge.

**Audit Findings:**

**CRITICAL BLOCKERS (P0):**
1. **Packages Not Published** - `@thesage/ui` and `@thesage/mcp` return 404 from npm, making installation instructions impossible to follow
2. **Component Count Inaccurate** - Documentation claims "48 components" but reality is 60+ exported, 36 in MCP registry
3. **Missing Prerequisites** - No documentation of required Node.js version, peer dependencies (react, framer-motion), or Tailwind configuration

**HIGH-SEVERITY ISSUES (P1):**
- ThemeProvider props not documented
- Motion system (0-10 scale) not explained
- MCP install command won't work (package not published)

**MODERATE ISSUES (P2):**
- Component-first architecture callout appears before users have context
- Tailwind configuration guide missing entirely
- No troubleshooting section in Getting Started

**MINOR ISSUES (P3):**
- Inconsistent internal link patterns (#quick-start vs #overview/quick-start)
- "Usage Guide" filename mismatch
- 40+ components missing from MCP registry

**CONTENT GAPS:**
- No "What's Next?" section after setup
- System requirements not listed
- MCP local development setup missing
- CLI commands not documented

**Implementation Plan:**

Created comprehensive 4-phase implementation plan:
- **Phase 0: Critical Blockers** (1-2 days) - Fix package publication issue, accurate counts, prerequisites
- **Phase 1: Pre-External Review** (2-3 days) - Document ThemeProvider, motion system, fix MCP
- **Phase 2: Important Improvements** (3-5 days) - Tailwind config, troubleshooting, content gaps
- **Phase 3: Polish** (2-3 days) - Consistency, MCP completeness, CLI reference

**Deliverables:**

1. **Audit Document:** `apps/web/docs/SAGE-UI-AUDIT.md`
   - Complete issue descriptions with file paths and line numbers
   - Evidence from actual codebase
   - Concrete solutions for each issue
   - Phased implementation checklist
   - Resume prompt for LLMs to continue work
   - Success metrics and completion criteria

2. **External Links Verified:** All GitHub and documentation links tested (6/6 passing)

3. **Component Inventory:** Actual counts per category:
   - Actions: 5 (claimed 3)
   - Forms: 18 (claimed 11)
   - Navigation: 10 (claimed 6)
   - Overlays: 11 (claimed 9)
   - Feedback: 6 (claimed 5)
   - Data Display: 16 (claimed 6)
   - Layout: 15 (claimed 8)
   - **Plus:** backgrounds (2), blocks (multiple), cursor (2), motion (multiple)
   - **Total:** 85+ components in codebase, 90+ exported, only 36 in MCP registry

**Key Insight:**

The documentation is well-written and thoughtfully structured, but currently describes a system that cannot be installed by following its own instructions. This must be fixed before external technical reviews.

**Recommendation:** DO NOT show documentation to Teg or external reviewers until Phase 0 (Critical Blockers) is complete.

**Files Changed:**
- Added: `apps/web/docs/SAGE-UI-AUDIT.md` (comprehensive audit with implementation plan)
- Updated: `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry)

**Next Steps:**
1. Decide: Publish packages to npm OR rewrite docs for monorepo-only setup
2. Implement Phase 0 fixes (critical blockers)
3. Update all component count references
4. Add prerequisites and peer dependency documentation

### Typography System - Phase 5 Complete ✅

**OG Card Font Integration**

Completed integration of the Typography System with the Open Graph Card customizer. Users can now select from 29 Google Fonts when designing OG cards, with full support for dynamic font loading in edge runtime.

#### Changes Made

**Updated `OpenGraphCardPage.tsx`:**
- Expanded `AVAILABLE_FONTS` list from 15 to 29 fonts
- Added all fonts from Typography System:
  - Abril Fatface, Fredoka, IBM Plex Mono, IBM Plex Sans, Karla, Lato, Libre Bodoni, Merriweather, Montserrat, Nunito, Nunito Sans, Poppins, Work Sans
- Fixed deprecated font: "Source Sans Pro" → "Source Sans 3"
- Fonts sorted alphabetically for better UX

**Verified Existing Functionality:**
- ✅ `SavedOGDesign` interface already includes `fontFamily: string` (line 35)
- ✅ Font selector UI already implemented with Select component (lines 361-376)
- ✅ Font family state management working (`useState`, save/load, delete)
- ✅ Edge Config sync includes fontFamily in payload (line 170)
- ✅ `opengraph-image.tsx` has complete font loading via Google Fonts API (lines 47-94)
- ✅ Dynamic font loading works in Edge Runtime using Satori
- ✅ Font applied to ImageResponse via fonts array (lines 189-198, 221, 263)

#### Technical Details

**Font Loading in Edge Runtime:**
- Uses `loadFont()` helper to fetch TTF/OTF from Google Fonts
- Old browser User-Agent trick forces Google to serve TTF instead of WOFF2 (Satori requirement)
- Gracefully handles font loading failures with fallback to sans-serif
- Fonts are lazy-loaded only when OG image is generated (optimized)

**Available Fonts (29 total):**
```
Abril Fatface, Cormorant Garamond, Fira Code, Fredoka,
IBM Plex Mono, IBM Plex Sans, Instrument Sans, Inter,
JetBrains Mono, Karla, Lato, Libre Bodoni, Lora,
Manrope, Merriweather, Montserrat, Nunito, Nunito Sans,
Open Sans, Outfit, Playfair Display, Poppins, Quicksand,
Raleway, Roboto, Roboto Mono, Source Sans 3, Space Grotesk,
Work Sans
```

#### Verification

```
✅ web builds successfully (7.5s compile)
✅ AVAILABLE_FONTS updated with 29 fonts
✅ Source Sans Pro deprecated font fixed
✅ All typography system fonts included
✅ Font selector dropdown populates correctly
✅ Edge Config sync includes fontFamily
✅ opengraph-image.tsx loads fonts dynamically

### Typography System - Phase 3 Complete ✅

**Dynamic Font Loading System**

Implemented a comprehensive font loading system that manages 30+ Google Fonts for the typography theme system. While Next.js loads fonts statically at build time, this system provides dynamic application of fonts via CSS variables and tracking of font loading state.

#### New Files Created

**`lib/fonts-dynamic.ts`** - Font loading utilities
- Font registry with 21 Google Fonts pre-configured
- `getFontConfig(fontName)` - Get font configuration by name
- `getFontVariable(fontName)` - Get CSS variable for a font
- `getFontThemeVariables(fontTheme)` - Get all CSS variables for a theme
- `getFontThemeFamilies(fontTheme)` - Get all font families in a theme
- `isSystemFont(fontName)` - Check if font is a system font
- `getAllFontNames()` - Get all registered font names
- `markFontsAsLoaded(fontNames)` - Track loading status
- `areFontsLoaded(fontNames)` - Check if fonts are loaded
- `GOOGLE_FONTS_PRECONNECT` - Preconnect URLs for optimization

**`hooks/useFontThemeLoader.ts`** - React hook for font theme management
- `useFontThemeLoader(fontTheme, options)` - Main hook
- Returns: `status`, `isLoading`, `isLoaded`, `error`, `applyFontTheme()`, `resetFonts()`
- Automatically applies fonts via CSS variables to target element
- Tracks loading status: idle → loading → loaded/error
- Callbacks: `onLoaded`, `onError`
- `usePreloadFontTheme(fontTheme)` - Preload fonts without applying

**Updated `lib/fonts.ts`** - Extended font registry
- Added 21 new Google Font imports
- Total: 30+ fonts loaded
- All fonts configured with proper weights and display: swap
- System fonts (System UI, SF Mono) handled separately

#### Fonts Loaded

**New Fonts Added:**
- Inter, Roboto, Roboto Mono
- Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat
- Source Sans 3 (replaces Source Sans Pro)
- Raleway, Poppins, Work Sans
- Playfair Display, Merriweather
- Quicksand, Karla
- Cormorant Garamond, Libre Bodoni
- Abril Fatface, Fredoka
- JetBrains Mono
- IBM Plex Sans, IBM Plex Mono

**System Fonts (no loading required):**
- System UI
- SF Mono

#### Key Features

✅ **Static Loading** - All fonts loaded at build time via next/font/google
✅ **Dynamic Application** - Fonts applied via CSS variables at runtime
✅ **Loading Status** - Track and react to font loading state
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks if fonts fail to load
✅ **System Font Support** - Special handling for system fonts
✅ **Performance** - Font display: swap for optimal loading
✅ **Preconnect** - URLs provided for HTML head optimization

#### Usage Example

```typescript
import { useFontThemeLoader } from '@/hooks/useFontThemeLoader'
import { fontThemes } from '@thesage/tokens'

function FontThemePreview() {
  const voltTheme = fontThemes.find(ft => ft.id === 'volt')
  const { status, isLoaded, applyFontTheme, resetFonts } = useFontThemeLoader(voltTheme, {
    autoApply: true,
    targetSelector: '#preview',
    onLoaded: () => console.log('Fonts ready!'),
    onError: (err) => console.error(err),
  })

  return (
    <div id="preview">
      {status === 'loading' && <p>Loading fonts...</p>}
      {isLoaded && <p>Fonts loaded! Heading: Space Grotesk</p>}
      <button onClick={applyFontTheme}>Apply</button>
      <button onClick={resetFonts}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Technical Details

**Font Loading Strategy:**
- Next.js `next/font/google` loads fonts statically at build time
- Fonts are optimized and self-hosted automatically
- This system manages *application* of fonts via CSS variables

```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { useCustomizer } from '@thesage/ui'
import { fontThemes } from '@thesage/tokens'

const { applyFontTheme, getActiveFontTheme, saveFontTheme } = useCustomizer()

// Apply a curated theme
const voltTheme = fontThemes.find(ft => ft.id === 'volt')
applyFontTheme('studio', 'dark', voltTheme)

// Get active theme
const active = getActiveFontTheme('studio', 'dark')

// Save a custom theme
saveFontTheme({
  name: 'My Brand',
  description: 'Custom brand fonts',
  heading: 'Poppins',
  body: 'Inter',
  mono: 'Fira Code',
  // ... other properties
})
```

**Next Steps (Phases 3-6):**

### Phase 4: Legacy Migration Started (~25-30% Complete)

**Major Architectural Decision:**
- Skipped formal deprecation phase (Phase 4 originally planned)
- Going directly to migration since all usage is internal (3 apps only)
- No external consumers to notify or provide migration guides for

#### Infrastructure Setup in @thesage/ui ✅

**Utilities:**
- Added `lib/syntax-parser/` - Complete tokenizer system for code syntax highlighting
  - `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions (SyntaxType, SyntaxToken, Language)
  - `patterns.ts` - Regex patterns for JS/TS/JSX/TSX tokenization
  - `tokenizer.ts` - Core tokenization logic
  - `index.ts` - Public API with `parseCode()` function
- Added `lib/store/` - Zustand stores for state management
  - `theme.ts` - Theme state and persistence
  - `customizer.ts` - Customizer panel state
- Added `lib/validation.ts` - Form validation utilities

**Providers:**
- Added `providers/ThemeProvider.tsx` - Theme management and context

**Hooks:**
- Added `hooks/useTheme.ts` - Theme access and manipulation
- Added `hooks/useMotionPreference.ts` - Motion preference management
- Added `hooks/useForm.ts` - Form state and validation

#### Components Migrated to Functional Categories ✅

Migrated 15+ critical components from `@ecosystem/design-system` to `@thesage/ui`:

- **Actions:** Link
- **Forms:** ThemeSwitcher, ThemeToggle
- **Navigation:** NavLink
- **Data Display:** Code, CollapsibleCodeBlock, GitHubIcon, Heading, Text
- **Layout:** Header (with subdir), Footer (with subdir)
- **Feedback:** Toast (ToastProvider, useToast hook)

#### Critical Architecture Fix ✅

**Problem:** Initial migration accidentally created `components/molecules/` and `components/organisms/` directories, violating the functional organization principle.

**Solution:**
- Deleted `components/molecules/` and `components/organisms/` directories
- Reorganized all components into proper functional categories:
  - molecules/ThemeSwitcher → forms/ThemeSwitcher
  - molecules/ThemeToggle → forms/ThemeToggle
  - organisms/CollapsibleCodeBlock → data-display/CollapsibleCodeBlock
  - organisms/Toast → feedback/Toast
  - organisms/Header → layout/Header
  - organisms/Footer → layout/Footer

**Updated all exports:**
- Updated category index.ts files (actions, forms, navigation, data-display, layout, feedback)
- Updated main `/packages/ui/src/index.ts` to export all new components
- Removed all references to molecules/ and organisms/ directories

#### MCP Server Integration ✅

**Claude Desktop Configuration:**
- Added @thesage/mcp to Claude Desktop config
- Configuration file: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Uses local path: `node /Users/shalomormsby/Developer/work/ecosystem/packages/sds-mcp-server/dist/index.js`
- Enables Claude Desktop to browse, search, and install all 48 Sage UI components via natural language

#### Documentation Updates ✅

**SAGE_DESIGN_SYSTEM_STRATEGY.md:**
- Added "Quick Start: Resuming Phase 4 Migration" section at top
- Updated Phase 4 from "Planned" to "In Progress" with detailed status
- Added complete list of remaining components to migrate (~40 remaining)
- Added file location reference tree showing migrated component structure
- Updated roadmap to reflect Phase 4 in progress
- Added decision log entries for migration start and MCP configuration
- Updated status header to show current phase and completion percentage

### Remaining Work (Phase 4 - ~70% to go)

1. **Copy ~40 remaining components** from design-system to @thesage/ui
2. **Build @thesage/ui package** and resolve TypeScript errors
3. **Migrate app imports:**
   - Portfolio (~10 files)
   - Creative Powerup (~3 files)
   - Sage Studio (~30+ files)
4. **Remove legacy package** and delete design-system directory
5. **Verify all apps build successfully**

## 2025-12-31

### Added - Automatic Syntax Parser & Documentation Enhancement

#### New Feature: Lightweight Syntax Parser for Code Highlighting
- **Built-in automatic code tokenization** for TypeScript/JavaScript/JSX syntax highlighting
- **Zero-configuration** - just pass plain code strings to `CollapsibleCodeBlock`
- **Lightweight implementation** - ~2KB regex-based parser with O(n) performance
- **14 token types**: comment, keyword, function, string, number, boolean, operator, property, className, tag, attribute, variable, punctuation, plain
- **Theme-aware colors** - syntax highlighting adapts to light/dark mode with WCAG AA contrast
- **No external dependencies** - completely self-contained within design system

#### Core Components
- **`parseCode()` utility** (`design-system/utils/syntax-parser/`) - Automatic tokenization function
  ```typescript
  import { parseCode } from '@ecosystem/design-system/utils'
  const tokens = parseCode(`const greeting = "Hello World";`)
  ```
- **`CollapsibleCodeBlock` organism** - Enhanced with automatic syntax highlighting when `code` prop is a string
- **`Code` atom** - Simple inline/block code display without syntax highlighting
- **14 syntax color tokens** - CSS variables for manual styling (e.g., `var(--syntax-keyword)`)

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Auto-parsing happens automatically in CollapsibleCodeBlock
const tokens = useMemo(() => {
  return typeof code === 'string' ? parseCode(code) : code;
}, [code]);

// Supports both automatic and manual tokenization
<CollapsibleCodeBlock
  code={`your code string`}  // Auto-tokenizes
/>
<CollapsibleCodeBlock
  code={manualTokens}  // Or pass pre-tokenized array
/>
```

### Fixed - Comprehensive Code Block Documentation Update

#### Problem
Code blocks throughout Sage Studio lacked multi-color syntax highlighting despite the parser being built. All code examples used `Code inline={false}` which only applies single-color styling.

#### Solution
**Systematically replaced 36 instances** of `Code inline={false}` with `CollapsibleCodeBlock` across 6 documentation files:

| File | Instances Fixed | Code Block IDs |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| `OverviewSection.tsx` | 2 | basic-usage, theme-switching |
| `CommonPatternsSection.tsx` | 8 | pattern-1 to pattern-8 |
| `HooksSection.tsx` | 7 | hook-1 to hook-7 |
| `AddingComponentsSection.tsx` | 12 | add-comp-1 to add-comp-12 |
| `ArchitectureSection.tsx` | 1 | arch-1 |
| `OrganismsSection.tsx` | 6 | org-usage-1 to org-usage-6 |

**Transformation pattern**:
```typescript
// Before (single-color)
<Code inline={false} syntax="plain">{`code here`}</Code>

// After (multi-color with auto-parsing)
<CollapsibleCodeBlock
  id="unique-id"
  code={`code here`}
  defaultCollapsed={false}
  showCopy={true}
/>
```

#### Documentation Additions
- **Design System README** - Added comprehensive "Syntax Highlighting & Code Display" section with:
  - Quick example and feature overview
  - 14 syntax token types with CSS variable names
  - Manual usage examples for `parseCode()` utility
  - Component comparison guide (when to use `Code` vs `CollapsibleCodeBlock`)
  - Updated package exports to include syntax parser utilities

- **Sage Studio README** - Added "Syntax Highlighting" feature section highlighting:
  - Zero-configuration automatic parsing
  - Lightweight implementation details
  - Theme-aware color system
  - Reference to live documentation

- **Ecosystem Root README** - Added syntax parser to design system feature list

### Fixed - Styling System & Architecture

#### Critical Tailwind Configuration Fix
**Problem**: Tailwind wasn't processing any files - content paths pointed to non-existent `./src/` directories after restructure.

**Impact**: Zero styling applied - cards, grids, typography all broken.

**Solution**: Updated `tailwind.config.ts` content paths:
```typescript
content: [
  "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",       // Was: "./src/app/**/*"
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}", // Was: "./src/components/**/*"
  "./lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  "../../design-system/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
]
```

Added proper color variable mapping:
```typescript
colors: {
  background: "var(--color-background)",
  "background-secondary": "var(--color-background-secondary)",
  foreground: "var(--color-foreground)",
  primary: "var(--color-primary)",
  accent: "var(--color-accent)",
}
```

#### CSS Variables System Completion
Added missing design system CSS variables to `globals.css`:
- **Color variables**: `--color-glass-border`, `--color-background-secondary`
- **Effect variables**: `--effect-blur-*`, `--effect-shadow-*`
- **Typography variables**: `--font-heading`, `--font-body`, `--font-mono`
- **Motion variables**: `--ease-default`, `--ease-spring`
- **Theme transition styles**: `.theme-transitioning` class for smooth theme changes

### Fixed - Centralized Font Architecture (Critical)

#### The Problem: Duplicate Font Configurations
**Initial approach** (WRONG):
- Each app defined its own font loading in `lib/fonts.ts`
- Font variable names were inconsistent across apps
- ThemeProvider expected specific variable names but apps used different ones
- Result: **Font switching in Customizer didn't work**

#### The Solution: Configuration vs Implementation Pattern
**Architectural principle**: Design-system defines WHAT, apps define HOW.

**Design-System Layer** (Configuration - Framework Agnostic):
- Created `design-system/fonts/index.ts` exporting font configurations:
  ```typescript
  export interface FontConfig {
    family: string;      // "Inter"
    variable: string;    // "--font-studio-heading"
    weight: string[];    // ["400", "500", "600", "700"]
    subsets?: string[];
    display?: string;
  }
  ```
- Defines canonical variable names ThemeProvider expects
- No framework dependencies (Next.js, etc.)
- Single source of truth for font specifications

**App Layer** (Implementation - Framework Specific):
- Apps load fonts with `next/font/google` using config specifications
- Both `creative-powerup` and `portfolio` use identical variable names
- Example:
  ```typescript
  export const studioHeading = Inter({
    variable: '--font-studio-heading',  // From design-system config
    weight: ['400', '500', '600', '700'],
  });
  ```

#### Why This Architecture Matters
**Before**:
- ❌ Duplication across apps
- ❌ Inconsistent variable names
- ❌ Font switching broken
- ❌ Design-system tied to Next.js

**After**:
- ✅ Single source of truth in design-system
- ✅ Consistent variable names guaranteed
- ✅ Font switching works automatically via ThemeProvider
- ✅ Framework-agnostic design-system (can support Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- ✅ Apps remain framework-specific (Next.js font optimization)

#### Implementation Details
1. **ThemeProvider** (`design-system/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`) sets font CSS variables dynamically:
   ```typescript
   '--font-heading': fonts?.heading || 'var(--font-studio-heading)',
   '--font-body': fonts?.body || 'var(--font-studio-body)',
   '--font-mono': fonts?.mono || 'var(--font-studio-mono)',
   ```

2. **Font maps** defined for each theme:
   - Studio: `--font-studio-heading`, `--font-studio-body`, `--font-studio-mono`
   - Sage: `--font-sage-sans`, `--font-sage-serif`, `--font-sage-mono`
   - Volt: `--font-volt-sans`, `--font-volt-mono`

3. **Apps load all fonts** upfront, ThemeProvider switches which ones are active

### Results
- ✅ Creative Sandbox builds successfully
- ✅ All styling applied correctly (Tailwind + CSS variables)
- ✅ Font switching works with theme changes
- ✅ Zero duplication in font configuration
- ✅ Design-system remains framework-agnostic
- ✅ Both portfolio and creative-powerup use identical font system

### Technical Debt Resolved
- Removed incorrect `design-system/fonts/nextjs.ts` (attempted to load Next.js fonts in library)
- Removed duplicate font configs with wrong variable names
- Fixed TypeScript path aliases in `tsconfig.json` (`"@/*": ["./*"]` instead of `"./src/*"`)
- Updated both apps to React 19 for consistency

## 2025-12-16T14:32:00Z

- Added AGENTS.md with comprehensive guidance for AI collaborators
- Updated DESIGN-PHILOSOPHY.md to elevate "Lovable by Design" as North Star and provide practical guidance for how to encode human-centered principles into every creative decision we make.

## 2025-12-15

### Fixed - Comprehensive Theme System Audit & Completion (Latest)

#### Typography System Enhancement
- **Automatic heading font switching** - All h1-h6 elements now use `var(--font-heading)` automatically
- **Theme-specific typography attributes**:
  - **Studio**: Semi-bold headings (600), tight spacing (-0.02em), clean sans-serif
  - **Sage**: Semi-bold serif headings (Lora 600), relaxed spacing, elegant body text (Instrument Sans)
  - **Volt**: Bold headings (Space Grotesk 700), very tight spacing (-0.03em), geometric sans
- **Typography preview** in Customizer showing active fonts for each theme
- **Font loading references**:
  - Studio: Inter (placeholder for Geist) + JetBrains Mono
  - Sage: Instrument Sans (body) + Lora (headings) + JetBrains Mono (code)
  - Volt: Space Grotesk (both) + Fira Code (code)

#### Theme Token Completion
- **Sage theme fully implemented** with complete color palettes for both light and dark modes:
  - Light: Warm earthy tones (#faf8f5 background, #7a9b7f sage green, #c17a5f terracotta accent)
  - Dark: Deep forest backgrounds (#1a1614) with brighter sage greens and warm peachy accents
  - Complete effects (blur, shadow) and motion curves (slower, organic animations 300-840ms)
- **Volt theme fully implemented** with vibrant cyberpunk aesthetic:
  - Light: Electric blues (#0066ff), vibrant cyan (#00d9ff), sharp contrast
  - Dark: Pure black (#000000) with neon colors (#0099ff, #00ffff), glow shadows
  - Complete effects with glow-style shadows and fast, snappy animations (100-325ms)

#### Global Theme Application
- **Fixed Tailwind config** to use CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors
  - All `neutral.*` shades now use `color-mix()` to blend foreground/background dynamically
  - `background`, `foreground`, `primary`, `accent` all reference theme CSS variables
  - Font families reference theme-specific font variables
- **Fixed Experience Customizer** to be fully theme-aware:
  - Panel background uses glass effect with blur
  - All colors reference CSS variables (no more hardcoded `bg-white`, `text-black`)
  - Active states use `--color-primary` for consistency across themes
- **Fixed all portfolio pages** to remove hardcoded colors:
  - Home page: All `text-neutral-*`, `bg-neutral-*` → `text-foreground`, `bg-background`
  - About page: All `text-gray-*` → `text-foreground` with opacity
  - Not Found page: All colors converted to theme-aware classes

#### Visual Theme Differentiation
Now when switching themes, users see dramatically different experiences:
- **Studio**: Clean, professional grays and blues (like Vercel/Linear)
- **Sage**: Warm earth tones, muted greens, organic feel
- **Volt**: Electric blues, sharp contrast, cyberpunk neon (especially in dark mode)

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Light/Dark mode only applying to 3 cards → now applies **globally** to entire app
- Fixed Customizer panel not responding to theme changes
- Fixed "Built with Transparent Design" section colors
- Fixed hydration warnings with `suppressHydrationWarning` on html/body tags

---

### Added - Multi-Theme Design System Architecture (Initial Release)

#### Theme System Foundation
- **Multi-theme architecture** supporting 3 distinct design languages:
  - **Studio** (🏢): Professional, balanced aesthetic inspired by Framer, Vercel, Linear
  - **Sage** (🌿): Calm, organic, feminine/yin aesthetic (placeholder for Phase 2)
  - **Volt** (⚡): Bold, electric, masculine/yang aesthetic (placeholder for Phase 3)
- Each theme supports both **light** and **dark** modes (6 total combinations)
- Separation of concerns: primitives (headless components) vs themes (visual identities)

#### Token System
- **Base tokens** (`design-system/tokens/base.ts`):
  - Shared spacing scale (0-32, 4px increments)
  - Typography scales (fontSize, fontWeight, lineHeight)
  - Border radius values
  - Duration values for animations
  - Easing curves
  - Z-index scales
- **Theme-specific tokens**:
  - `design-system/tokens/studio.ts` - Complete implementation
  - `design-system/tokens/sage.ts` - Placeholder structure
  - `design-system/tokens/volt.ts` - Placeholder structure
- **Token categories** per theme:
  - Colors (background, foreground, primary, accent, semantic colors, glass effects)
  - Effects (blur levels, shadow scales)
  - Motion (intensity-based duration calculation, theme-specific easing)
  - Typography (font family references)

#### Theme Switching & State Management
- **Zustand store** (`design-system/store/theme.ts`):
  - Theme selection (studio/sage/volt)
  - Mode selection (light/dark)
  - LocalStorage persistence
  - Type-safe theme configuration
- **ThemeProvider** (`design-system/providers/ThemeProvider.tsx`):
  - Converts theme tokens to CSS variables
  - Applies variables to `:root` element
  - Manages animated transitions (300ms fade)
  - Sets `data-theme` and `data-mode` attributes for conditional styling
  - Graceful fallbacks for incomplete theme definitions

#### Font Loading System
- **Theme-specific fonts** (`apps/portfolio/lib/fonts.ts`):
  - Studio: Inter (placeholder for Geist) + JetBrains Mono
  - Sage: Instrument Sans + Lora serif + JetBrains Mono
  - Volt: Space Grotesk + Fira Code
- **next/font optimization**: All fonts loaded upfront, swapped via CSS variables
- **Easy replacement**: Centralized font configuration for future updates

#### Component Integration
- **Button** (`design-system/atoms/Button/Button.tsx`):
  - Uses CSS variables for all colors
  - Variants: primary, secondary, ghost
  - Sizes: sm, md, lg
- **Card** (`design-system/atoms/Card/Card.tsx`):
  - Uses CSS variables for background, borders, shadows
  - Optional hover effects
  - Theme-aware styling
- **Motion components** (`design-system/atoms/Motion/index.tsx`):
  - FadeIn, StaggerContainer, StaggerItem
  - **Motion intensity integration**: Duration scales with customizer slider (0-10)
  - **Theme-specific motion**: Each theme has unique duration curves and easing
  - **Accessibility**: Intensity 0 = no animations

#### Experience Customizer UI
- **Updated CustomizerPanel** (`design-system/features/customizer/CustomizerPanel.tsx`):
  - Theme picker with emoji indicators (🏢 Studio, 🌿 Sage, ⚡ Volt)
  - Mode toggle (☀️ Light, 🌙 Dark)
  - Motion intensity slider (0-10)
- **Split stores**: Theme state separate from customizer state
- LocalStorage persistence for all settings

#### CSS Architecture
- **Global CSS variables** (`apps/portfolio/app/globals.css`):
  - Color variables (--color-background, --color-foreground, etc.)
  - Effect variables (--effect-blur-*, --effect-shadow-*)
  - Typography variables (--font-heading, --font-body, --font-mono)
  - Motion variables (--ease-default, --ease-spring)
- **Theme transition styles**:
  - `.theme-transitioning` class for smooth color/background transitions
  - 300ms transition duration with theme-specific easing

#### Motion System Features
- **Intensity-based durations**:
  - Studio: 150ms (intensity 1) → 490ms (intensity 10), linear scale
  - Sage: 300ms (intensity 1) → 840ms (intensity 10), slower, organic
  - Volt: 100ms (intensity 1) → 325ms (intensity 10), fast, snappy
- **Theme-specific easing**:
  - Studio: Smooth, professional curves
  - Sage: Organic, flowing curves
  - Volt: Bouncy, spring-loaded curves
- **Stagger timing**: Scales with motion intensity
- **Zero-motion mode**: Complete animation disable for accessibility

### Technical Details

#### Architecture Decisions
- **CSS variables over Tailwind JIT**: Enables runtime theme switching without recompilation
- **Zustand over Context**: Better performance, simpler API, built-in persistence
- **Token-driven design**: All visual properties defined in tokens, not in components
- **Graceful degradation**: Optional chaining ensures placeholder themes don't break

## Notes

This release establishes the foundation for a scalable, multi-theme design system that can power multiple projects with distinct visual identities while sharing the same component primitives. The system is fully token-driven, enabling easy customization and brand adaptation.
